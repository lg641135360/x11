<H1 ALIGN=center>8.5 Font Metrics</H1>

<!.IN "Font">
A font is a graphical description of a set of characters that are used to 
increase efficiency whenever a set of small, similar sized patterns are 
repeatedly used.

<P>

This section discusses how to:

The X server loads fonts whenever a program requests a new font.
The server can cache fonts for quick lookup.
Fonts are global across all screens in a server.
Several levels are possible when dealing with fonts.
Most applications simply use 
<B><A HREF="XLoadQueryFont.html">XLoadQueryFont()</A></B>
to load a font and query the font metrics.

<P>

Characters in fonts are regarded as masks.
Except for image text requests,
the only pixels modified are those in which bits are set to 1 in the character.
This means that it makes sense to draw text using stipples or tiles
(for example, many menus gray-out unusable entries).

<P>

The
<B>XFontStruct</B>
structure contains all of the information for the font
and consists of the font-specific information as well as
a pointer to an array of
<B>XCharStruct</B>
structures for the
characters contained in the font.
The
<B>XFontStruct</B>,
<B>XFontProp</B>,
and
<B>XCharStruct</B>
structures contain:

<P>

X supports single byte/character, two bytes/character matrix,
and 16-bit character text operations.
Note that any of these forms can be used with a font, but a
single byte/character text request can only specify a single byte
(that is, the first row of a 2-byte font).
You should view 2-byte fonts as a two-dimensional matrix of defined
characters: byte1 specifies the range of defined rows and
byte2 defines the range of defined columns of the font.
Single byte/character fonts have one row defined, and the byte2 range
specified in the structure defines a range of characters.

<P>

The bounding box of a character is defined by the 
<B>XCharStruct</B>
of that character.
When characters are absent from a font,
the default_char is used.
When fonts have all characters of the same size,
only the information in the
<B>XFontStruct</B>
min and max bounds are used.

<P>

The members of the 
<B>XFontStruct</B>
have the following semantics:

<UL>

<P><LI>
The direction member can be either 
<B>FontLeftToRight</B>
or 
<B>FontRightToLeft</B>. 
It is just a hint as to whether most 
<B>XCharStruct</B>
elements 
have a positive 
(<B>FontLeftToRight</B>) 
or a negative 
(<B>FontRightToLeft</B>)
character width 
metric.
The core protocol defines no support for vertical text.

<P><LI>
If the min_byte1 and max_byte1 members are both zero, min_char_or_byte2
specifies the linear character index corresponding to the first element
of the per_char array, and max_char_or_byte2 specifies the linear character
index of the last element.

<P>

If either min_byte1 or max_byte1 are nonzero, both
min_char_or_byte2 and max_char_or_byte2 are less than 256, 
and the 2-byte character index values corresponding to the
per_char array element N (counting from 0) are:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	byte1 = N/D + min_byte1<BR>
	byte2 = N\D + min_char_or_byte2
</BLOCKQUOTE>
where:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
        D = max_char_or_byte2 - min_char_or_byte2 + 1<BR>
        / = integer division<BR>
        \ = integer modulus
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><LI>
If the per_char pointer is NULL, 
all glyphs between the first and last character indexes
inclusive have the same information,
as given by both min_bounds and max_bounds.

<P><LI>
If all_chars_exist is 
<B>True</B>,
all characters in the per_char array have nonzero bounding boxes.

<P><LI>
The default_char member specifies the character that will be used when an
undefined or nonexistent character is printed.  
The default_char is a 16-bit character (not a 2-byte character).
For a font using 2-byte matrix format, 
the default_char has byte1 in the most-significant byte
and byte2 in the least-significant byte.
If the default_char itself specifies an undefined or nonexistent character, 
no printing is performed for an undefined or nonexistent character.

<P><LI>
The min_bounds and max_bounds members contain the most extreme values of
each individual 
<B>XCharStruct</B>
component over all elements of this array
(and ignore nonexistent characters).
The bounding box of the font (the smallest
rectangle enclosing the shape obtained by superimposing all of the
characters at the same origin [x,y]) has its upper-left coordinate at:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<I>[x + min_bounds.lbearing, y - max_bounds.ascent]</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Its width is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<I>max_bounds.rbearing - min_bounds.lbearing</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Its height is:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<I>max_bounds.ascent + max_bounds.descent</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><LI>
The ascent member is the logical extent of the font above the baseline that is
used for determining line spacing.
Specific characters may extend beyond
this.

<P><LI>
The descent member is the logical extent of the font at or below the
baseline that is used for determining line spacing.
Specific characters may extend beyond this.

<P><LI>
If the baseline is at Y-coordinate y,
the logical extent of the font is inclusive between the Y-coordinate 
values (y - font.ascent) and (y + font.descent - 1).
Typically,
the minimum interline spacing between rows of text is given
by ascent + descent.

</UL>

<P>

For a character origin at [x,y],
the bounding box of a character (that is, 
the smallest rectangle that encloses the character's shape)
described in terms of 
<B>XCharStruct</B>
components is a rectangle with its upper-left corner at:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>[x + lbearing, y - ascent]</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Its width is:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<I>rbearing - lbearing</U>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Its height is:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>ascent + descent</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The origin for the next character is defined to be:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>[x + width, y]</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The lbearing member defines the extent of the left edge of the character ink
from the origin.
The rbearing member defines the extent of the right edge of the character ink
from the origin.
The ascent member defines the extent of the top edge of the character ink
from the origin.
The descent member defines the extent of the bottom edge of the character ink
from the origin.
The width member defines the logical width of the character.

<P>

Note that the baseline (the y position of the character origin) 
is logically viewed as being the scanline just below nondescending characters. 
When descent is zero,
only pixels with Y-coordinates less than y are drawn,
and the origin is logically viewed as being coincident with the left edge of
a nonkerned character. 
When lbearing is zero,
no pixels with X-coordinate less than x are drawn.
Any of the
<B>XCharStruct</B>
metric members could be negative.
If the width is negative,
the next character will be placed to the left of the current origin.

<P>

The X protocol does not define the interpretation of the attributes member 
in the
<B>XCharStruct</B>
structure.
A nonexistent character is represented with all members of its
<B>XCharStruct</B>
set to zero.

<P>

A font is not guaranteed to have any properties.
The interpretation of the property value (for example, long or unsigned long)
must be derived from <B>a priori</B> knowledge of the property. 
A basic set of font properties is specified in the X Consortium standard
<B>X Logical Font Description Conventions</B>.
