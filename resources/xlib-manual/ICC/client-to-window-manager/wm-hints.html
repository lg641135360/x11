<H1 ALIGN=center>14.1.6 Setting and Reading the WM_HINTS Property</H1>

Xlib provides functions that you can use to set and read 
the <A HREF="/gui/x/icccm/sec-4.html#WM_HINTS">WM_HINTS</A> property for a given window.
These functions use the flags and the
<B>XWMHints</B>
structure, as defined in the
<B><TT>X11/Xutil.h</TT></B>
header file.

<P>

To allocate an
<B>XWMHints</B>
structure, use
<B><A HREF="XAllocWMHints.html">XAllocWMHints()</A></B>.

<A NAME="XWMHints"></A>
<P>

The
<B>XWMHints</B>
structure contains:

<P>

<PRE><CODE>
/* Window manager hints mask bits */

#define	<B>InputHint</B>	(1L << 0)
#define	<B>StateHint</B>	(1L << 1)
#define	<B>IconPixmapHint</B>	(1L << 2)
#define	<B>IconWindowHint</B>	(1L << 3)
#define	<B>IconPositionHint</B>	(1L << 4)
#define	<B>IconMaskHint</B>	(1L << 5)
#define	<B>WindowGroupHint</B>	(1L << 6)
#define	<B>UrgencyHint</B>	(1L << 8)
#define	<B>AllHints</B> 	(InputHint|StateHint|IconPixmapHint|IconWindowHint|IconPositionHint|IconMaskHint|WindowGroupHint)
</PRE></CODE>

/* Values */

typedef struct {
	long flags;		/* marks which fields in this structure are defined */
	Bool input;		/* does this application rely on the window manager to
				   get keyboard input? */
	int initial_state;	/* see below */
	Pixmap icon_pixmap;	/* pixmap to be used as icon */
	Window icon_window;	/* window to be used as icon */
	int icon_x, icon_y;	/* initial position of icon */
	Pixmap icon_mask;	/* pixmap to be used as mask for icon_pixmap */
	XID window_group;	/* id of related window group */
	/* this structure may be extended in the future */
} XWMHints;
</PRE></CODE>

<P>

The <B>input</B> member is used to communicate to the window manager the input focus
model used by the application.
Applications that expect input but never explicitly set focus to any 
of their subwindows (that is, use the push model of focus management), 
such as X Version 10 style applications that use real-estate
driven focus, should set this member to 
<B>True</B>.  
Similarly, applications
that set input focus to their subwindows only when it is given to their
top-level window by a window manager should also set this member to 
<B>True</B>.
Applications that manage their own input focus by explicitly setting
focus to one of their subwindows whenever they want keyboard input 
(that is, use the pull model of focus management) should set this member to 
<B>False</B>.
Applications that never expect any keyboard input also should set this member
to 
<B>False</B>.

<P>

Pull model window managers should make it possible for push model
applications to get input by setting input focus to the top-level windows of
applications whose input member is 
<B>True</B>.  
Push model window managers should
make sure that pull model applications do not break them 
by resetting input focus to 
<B>PointerRoot</B> 
when it is appropriate (for example, whenever an application whose
input member is 
<B>False</B> 
sets input focus to one of its subwindows).

<P>

The definitions for the <B>initial_state</B> flag are:

<PRE><CODE>
#define	<B>WithdrawnState</B>	0
#define	<B>NormalState</B>	1	/* most applications start this way */
#define	<B>IconicState</B>	3	/* application wants to start as an icon */
</PRE></CODE>

The <B>icon_mask</B> specifies which pixels of the icon_pixmap should be used as the
icon.  
This allows for nonrectangular icons.
Both <B>icon_pixmap</B> and <B>icon_mask</B> must be bitmaps.
The <B>icon_window</B> lets an application provide a window for use as an icon
for window managers that support such use.
The <B>window_group</B> lets you specify that this window belongs to a group
of other windows.
For example, if a single application manipulates multiple 
top-level windows, this allows you to provide enough
information that a window manager can iconify all of the windows
rather than just the one window.

<P>

The
<B>UrgencyHint</B>
flag, if set in the <B>flags</B> field, indicates that the client deems the window
contents to be urgent, requiring the timely response of the user.  The
window manager will make some effort to draw the user's attention to this
window while this flag is set.  The client must provide some means by which the
user can cause the urgency flag to be cleared (either mitigating
the condition that made the window urgent or merely shutting off the alarm)
or the window to be withdrawn.
