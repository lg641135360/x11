<H1 ALIGN=center>14.1.1 Manipulating Top-Level Windows</H1>

Xlib provides functions that you can use to change the visibility or size
of top-level windows (that is, those that were created as children 
of the root window).
Note that the subwindows that you create are ignored by window managers.
Therefore,
you should use the basic window functions described in "<A HREF="../../window/">Window Functions</A>"
to manipulate your application's subwindows.

<P>

To request that a top-level window be iconified, use
<B><A HREF="XIconifyWindow.html">XIconifyWindow()</A></B>.

<P>

To request that a top-level window be withdrawn, use
<B><A HREF="XWithdrawWindow.html">XWithdrawWindow()</A></B>.

<P>

To request that a top-level window be reconfigured, use
<B><A HREF="XReconfigureWMWindow.html">XReconfigureWMWindow()</A></B>.
