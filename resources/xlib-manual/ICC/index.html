<H1 ALIGN=center>Chapter 14: Inter-Client Communication Functions</H1>

The <B><A HREF="/gui/x/icccm/">Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual</A></B>,
hereafter referred to as the ICCCM, details the
X Consortium approved conventions that govern inter-client communications.
These conventions ensure peer-to-peer client cooperation in the use 
of selections, cut buffers, and shared resources as well as client cooperation
with window and session managers.
For further information,
see the <B><A HREF="/gui/x/icccm/">Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual</A></B>.

<P>

Xlib provides a number of standard properties and programming interfaces
that are <A HREF="/gui/x/icccm/">ICCCM</A> compliant.
The predefined atoms for some of these properties are defined in the
<B><TT>X11/Xatom.h</TT></B>
header file, where
to avoid name conflicts with user symbols their
<B<#define</B>
name has an XA_ prefix.
For further information about atoms and properties,
see section "<A HREF="../window-information/properties-and-atoms.html">Properties and Atoms</A>".

<P>

Xlib's selection and cut buffer mechanisms provide the primary programming 
interfaces by which peer client applications communicate with each other 
(see sections "<A HREF="../window-information/selection.html">Selections</A>" and "<A HREF="../utilities/using-cut-buffers.html">Using Cut Buffers</A>").
The functions discussed in this chapter provide 
the primary programming interfaces by which client applications communicate 
with their window and session managers as well as share standard colormaps.

<P>

The standard properties that are of special interest for communicating 
with window and session managers are:
