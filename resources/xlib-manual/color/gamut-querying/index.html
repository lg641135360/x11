<H1 ALIGN=center>6.11 Gamut Querying Functions</H1>

This section describes the gamut querying functions that Xlib provides.
These functions allow the client to query the boundary 
of the screen's color gamut in terms of the CIE L*a*b*, CIE L*u*v*, 
and TekHVC color spaces.
<!.IN "Gamut querying">
Functions are also provided that allow you to query 
the color specification of:

<UL>
<P><LI>
White (full intensity red, green, and blue)

<P><LI>
Red (full intensity red while green and blue are zero)

<P><LI>
Green (full intensity green while red and blue are zero)

<P><LI>
Blue (full intensity blue while red and green are zero)

<P><LI>
Black (zero intensity red, green, and blue)
</UL>

<P>

The white point associated with color specifications passed to 
and returned from these gamut querying
functions is assumed to be the Screen White Point.
<!.IN "Screen White Point">
This is a reasonable assumption,
because the client is trying to query the screen's color gamut.

<P>

The following naming convention is used for the Max and Min functions:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
Xcms<I>&lt;color_space&gt;</I>QueryMax<I>&lt;dimensions&gt;</I>
<BR>
Xcms<I>&lt;color_space&gt;</I>QueryMin<I>&lt;dimensions&gt;</I>
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The &lt;dimensions&gt; consists of a letter or letters 
that identify the dimensions of the color space 
that are not fixed.
For example, 
<B><A HREF="XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxC.html">XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxC()</A></B>
is given a fixed Hue and Value for which maximum Chroma is found.
