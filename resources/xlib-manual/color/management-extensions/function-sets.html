Functions to convert between device-dependent color spaces
and CIE XYZ may differ for different classes of output devices
(for example, color versus gray monitors).
Therefore, the notion of a Color Characterization Function Set
has been developed.
A function set consists of device-dependent color spaces
and the functions that convert color specifications 
between these device-dependent color spaces and the CIE XYZ color space
appropriate for a particular class of output devices.
The function set also contains a function that reads
color characterization data off root window properties.
It is this characterization data that will differ between devices within
a class of output devices.
<!.IN "Device Color Characterization">
For details about how color characterization data is
stored in root window properties,
see the section on Device Color Characterization in the
<I><A HREF="/gui/x/icccm/">Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual</A></I>.
The LINEAR_RGB function set is provided by Xlib
and will support most color monitors.
Function sets may require data that differs
from those needed for the LINEAR_RGB function set.
In that case, 
its corresponding data may be stored on different root window properties.
