The CIE XYZ color space serves as the hub for all
conversions between device-independent and device-dependent color spaces.
Therefore, the knowledge to convert an 
<A HREF="../structures.html#XcmsColor">XcmsColor</A>
structure to and from CIE XYZ format is associated with each color space.
For example, conversion from CIE L*u*v* to RGB requires the knowledge
to convert from CIE L*u*v* to CIE XYZ and from CIE XYZ to RGB.
This knowledge is stored as an array of functions that,
when applied in series, will convert the 
<A HREF="../structures.html#XcmsColor">XcmsColor</A>
structure to or from CIE XYZ format.
This color specification conversion mechanism facilitates
the addition of color spaces.

<P>

Of course, when converting between only device-independent color spaces
or only device-dependent color spaces,
shortcuts are taken whenever possible.
For example, conversion from TekHVC to CIE L*u*v* is performed 
by intermediate conversion to CIE u*v*Y and then to CIE L*u*v*, 
thus bypassing conversion between CIE u*v*Y and CIE XYZ.
