<H1 ALIGN=center>3.5 Mapping Windows</H1>

A window is considered mapped if an 
<B><A HREF="XMapWindow.html">XMapWindow()</A></B>
call has been made on it.
It may not be visible on the screen for one of the following reasons:

<UL>

<P><LI>
It is obscured by another opaque window.

<P><LI>
One of its ancestors is not mapped.

<P><LI>
It is entirely clipped by an ancestor.
</UL>

<B><A HREF="../events/exposure/expose.html">Expose</A></B> 
events are generated for the window when part or all of
it becomes visible on the screen. 
A client receives the
<B><A HREF="../events/exposure/expose.html">Expose</A></B> 
events only if it has asked for them.
Windows retain their position in the stacking order when they are unmapped.

<P>

A window manager may want to control the placement of subwindows.
If 
<B><A HREF="../events/processing-overview.html#SubstructureRedirectMask">SubstructureRedirectMask</A></B> 
has been selected by a window manager
on a parent window (usually a root window),
a map request initiated by other clients on a child window is not performed,
and the window manager is sent a 
<B>MapRequest</B>
event.
However, if the override-redirect flag on the child had been set to
<B>True</B>
(usually only on pop-up menus),
the map request is performed.

<P>

A tiling window manager might decide to reposition and resize other clients' 
windows and then decide to map the window to its final location.
A window manager that wants to provide decoration might
reparent the child into a frame first.
For further information,
see "<A HREF="attributes/override-redirect.html">Override Redirect Flag</A>" and 
"<A HREF="../events/window-state-change/">Window State Change Events</A>".
Only a single client at a time can select for 
<B><A HREF="../events/processing-overview.html#SubstructureRedirectMask">SubstructureRedirectMask</A></B>.

<P>

Similarly, a single client can select for 
<B><A HREF="../events/processing-overview.html#ResizeRedirectMask">ResizeRedirectMask</A></B> 
on a parent window.
Then, any attempt to resize the window by another client is suppressed, and
the client receives a 
<B><A HREF="../events/structure-control/resize.html">ResizeRequest</A></B> 
event.

<P>

To map a given window, use 
<B><A HREF="XMapWindow.html">XMapWindow()</A></B>.

<P>

To map and raise a window, use
<B><A HREF="XMapRaised.html">XMapRaised()</A></B>.

<P>

To map all subwindows for a specified window, use 
<B><A HREF="XMapSubwindows.html">XMapSubwindows()</A></B>.
