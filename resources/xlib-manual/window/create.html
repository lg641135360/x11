<H1 ALIGN=center>3.3 Creating Windows</H1>

Xlib provides basic ways for creating windows,
and toolkits often supply higher-level functions specifically for
creating and placing top-level windows,
which are discussed in the appropriate toolkit documentation.
If you do not use a toolkit, however,
you must provide some standard information or hints for the window
manager by using the <B><A HREF="../ICC/">Xlib inter-client communication functions</A></B>.

<P>

If you use Xlib to create your own top-level windows
(direct children of the root window),
you must observe the following rules so that all applications interact
reasonably across the different styles of window management:

<UL>
<P><LI>
You must never fight with the window manager for the size or
placement of your top-level window.
<P><LI>
You must be able to deal with whatever size window you get, 
even if this means that your application just prints a message 
like ``Please make me bigger'' in its window.
<P><LI>
You should only attempt to resize or move top-level windows in
direct response to a user request.
If a request to change the size of a top-level window fails,
you must be prepared to live with what you get.
You are free to resize or move the children of top-level
windows as necessary.
(Toolkits often have facilities for automatic relayout.)
<P><LI>
If you do not use a toolkit that automatically sets standard window properties,
you should set these properties for top-level windows before mapping them.

<B><A HREF="XCreateWindow.html">XCreateWindow()</A></B>
is the more general function that allows you to set specific window attributes 
when you create a window.
<B><A HREF="XCreateWindow.html">XCreateSimpleWindow()</A></B>
creates a window that inherits its attributes from its parent window.

<A NAME="InputClass"></A>
<P>

<!.IN "Window" "InputOnly">
The X server acts as if 
<B><A HREF="create.html#InputClass">InputOnly</A></B> 
windows do not exist for
the purposes of graphics requests, exposure processing, and
<B><A HREF="../events/window-state-change/visibility.html">VisibilityNotify</A></B> 
events.
An 
<B><A HREF="create.html#InputClass">InputOnly</A></B> 
window cannot be used as a
drawable (that is, as a source or destination for graphics requests).
<B><A HREF="create.html#InputClass">InputOnly</A></B>
and 
<B>InputOutput</B>
windows act identically in other respects (properties,
grabs, input control, and so on).
Extension packages can define other classes of windows.

<P>

To create an unmapped window and set its window attributes, use
<B><A HREF="XCreateWindow.html">XCreateWindow()</A></B>.

<P>

To create an unmapped 
<B>InputOutput</B>
subwindow of a given parent window, use
<B><A HREF="XCreateWindow.html">XCreateSimpleWindow()</A></B>.
