<H1 ALIGN=center>Chapter 3: Window Functions</H1>

In the X Window System, 
a <B>window</B> is a rectangular area on the screen that lets you
view graphic output.
Client applications
can display overlapping and nested windows on one or more
screens that are driven by X servers on one or more machines.
Clients who want to create windows must first 
connect their program to the X server
by calling 
<B><A HREF="../display/opening.html">XOpenDisplay()</A></B>.
This chapter begins with a discussion of 
visual types and window attributes.
The chapter continues with a discussion of the Xlib functions you can use to:

<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="create.html">Create windows</A>
<LI> <A HREF="destroy.html">Destroy windows</A>
<LI> <A HREF="map.html">Map windows</A>
<LI> <A HREF="unmap.html">Unmap windows</A>
<LI> <A HREF="configure.html">Configure windows</A>
<LI> <A HREF="stacking-order.html">Change the stacking order</A>
<LI> <A HREF="change-attributes.html">Change window attributes</A>
</UL>

<P>

This chapter also identifies the window actions that may generate events.

Note that it is vital that your application conform to the
established conventions for communicating with window managers
for it to work well with the various window managers in use (see section "<A HREF="../ICC/client-to-window-manager/">Client to Window Manager Communication</A>").
Toolkits generally adhere to these conventions for you,
relieving you of the burden.
Toolkits also often supersede many functions in this chapter
with versions of their own.
Refer to the documentation for the toolkit you are using
for more information.
