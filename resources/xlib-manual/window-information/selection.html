<!.IN "Selection">
Selections are one method used by applications to exchange data.
By using the property mechanism,
applications can exchange data of arbitrary types and can negotiate
the type of the data.
A selection can be thought of as an indirect property with a dynamic type.
That is, rather than having the property stored in the X server,
the property is maintained by some client (the owner).
A selection is global in nature (considered to belong to the user 
but be maintained by clients) rather than being private to a particular 
window subhierarchy or a particular set of clients.

<P>

Xlib provides functions that you can use to set, get, or request conversion
of selections.
This allows applications to implement the notion of current selection,
which requires that notification be sent to applications when they no 
longer own the selection.
Applications that support selection often highlight the current selection
and so must be informed when another application has
acquired the selection so that they can unhighlight the selection.

<P>

When a client asks for the contents of
a selection, it specifies a selection target type.
This target type
can be used to control the transmitted representation of the contents.
For example, if the selection is ``the last thing the user clicked on''
and that is currently an image, then the target type might specify
whether the contents of the image should be sent in XY format or Z format.

<P>

The target type can also be used to control the class of
contents transmitted, for example, 
asking for the ``looks'' (fonts, line
spacing, indentation, and so forth) of a paragraph selection, not the
text of the paragraph.
The target type can also be used for other
purposes.
The protocol does not constrain the semantics.

<P>

To set the selection owner, use 
<B><A HREF="XSetSelectionOwner.html">XSetSelectionOwner()</A></B>.

<P>

To return the selection owner, use 
<B><A HREF="XGetSelectionOwner.html">XGetSelectionOwner()</A></B>.

<P>

To request conversion of a selection, use 
<B><A HREF="XConvertSelection.html">XConvertSelection()</A></B>.
