<H2>Arguments</H2>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD> <B>display</B>
<TD> Specifies the connection to the X server.

<TR><TD> <B>selection</B>
<TD> Specifies the selection atom.

<TR><TD> <B>owner</B>
<TD> Specifies the owner of the specified selection atom.
You can pass a window or
<B>None</B> .

<TR><TD> <B>time</B>
<TD> Specifies the time.
You can pass either a timestamp or
<B>CurrentTime</B>.

</TABLE>

<H2>Description</H2>

The
<B>XSetSelectionOwner()</B>
function changes the owner and last-change time for the specified selection
and has no effect if the specified time is earlier than the current
last-change time of the specified selection 
or is later than the current X server time.
Otherwise, the last-change time is set to the specified time,
with
<B>CurrentTime</B>
replaced by the current server time.
If the owner window is specified as
<B>None</B> ,
then the owner of the selection becomes 
<B>None</B>
(that is, no owner).
Otherwise, the owner of the selection becomes the client executing
the request.

<P>
 
If the new owner (whether a client or
<B>None</B> )
is not
the same as the current owner of the selection and the current
owner is not
<B>None</B> ,
the current owner is sent a 
<B><A HREF="../events/client-communication/selection-clear.html">SelectionClear</A></B> 
event.
If the client that is the owner of a selection is later
terminated (that is, its connection is closed)
or if the owner window it has specified in the request is later
destroyed,
the owner of the selection automatically
reverts to
<B>None</B> ,
but the last-change time is not affected.
The selection atom is uninterpreted by the X server.
<B><A HREF="XGetSelectionOwner.html">XGetSelectionOwner()</A></B>
returns the owner window, which is reported in 
<B><A HREF="../events/client-communication/selection-request.html">SelectionRequest</A></B>
and
<B><A HREF="../events/client-communication/selection-clear.html">SelectionClear</A></B>
events.
Selections are global to the X server.

<P>

<B>XSetSelectionOwner()</B>
can generate
<B>BadAtom</B>
and
<B>BadWindow</B> 
errors.

<H2>Diagnostics</H2>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD><B>BadAtom</B>
<TD> A value for an Atom argument does not name a
     defined Atom.

<TR><TD><B>BadWindow</B>
<TD>A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
