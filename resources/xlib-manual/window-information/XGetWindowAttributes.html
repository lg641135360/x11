<H2>Arguments</H2>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD> <B>display</B>
<TD> Specifies the connection to the X server.

<TR><TD> <B>w</B>
<TD> Specifies the window whose current attributes you want to obtain.

<TR><TD> <B>window_attributes_return</B>
<TD> Returns the specified window's attributes in the
<B>XWindowAttributes</B>

<H2>Description</H2>

The
<B>XGetWindowAttributes()</B>
function returns the current attributes for the specified window to an
<B>XWindowAttributes</B>
structure.

<P>

The <B>x</B> and <B>y</B> members are set to the upper-left outer
corner relative to the parent window's origin.<BR>
The <B>width</B>and <B>height</B> members are set to the inside size of the window, 
not including the border.<BR>
The <B>border_width</B> member is set to the window's border width in pixels.<BR>
The <B>depth</B> member is set to the depth of the window 
(that is, bits per pixel for the object).<BR>
The <B>visual</B> member is a pointer to the screen's associated
<B>Visual</B>
structure.<BR>
The <B>root</B> member is set to the root window of the screen containing the window.<BR>
The <B>class</B> member is set to the window's class and can be either
<B><A HREF="../window/create.html#InputClass">InputOutput</A></B>
or
<B><A HREF="../window/create.html#InputClass">InputOnly</A></B>.

<P>

The <B>bit_gravity</B> member is set to the window's bit gravity
and can be one of the following:

<P>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD><B>ForgetGravity</B>	<TD><B>EastGravity</B>
<TR><TD><B>NorthWestGravity</B>	<TD><B>SouthWestGravity</B>
<TR><TD><B>NorthGravity</B>	<TD><B>SouthGravity</B>
<TR><TD><B>NorthEastGravity</B>	<TD><B>SouthEastGravity</B>
<TR><TD><B>WestGravity</B>	<TD><B>StaticGravity</B>
<TR><TD><B>CenterGravity</B>
</TABLE>

<P>

The <B>win_gravity</B> member is set to the window's window gravity
and can be one of the following:

<P>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD><B>UnmapGravity</B>	<TD><B>EastGravity</B>
<TR><TD><B>NorthWestGravity</B>	<TD><B>SouthWestGravity</B>
<TR><TD><B>NorthGravity</B>	<TD><B>SouthGravity</B>
<TR><TD><B>NorthEastGravity</B>	<TD><B>SouthEastGravity</B>
<TR><TD><B>WestGravity</B>	<TD><B>StaticGravity</B>
<TR><TD><B>CenterGravity</B>
</TABLE>

<P>

For additional information on gravity,
see "<A HREF="../window/create.html">Creating Windows</A>".

<P>

The <B>backing_store</B> member is set to indicate how the X server should maintain
the contents of a window 
and can be 
<B>WhenMapped</B>,
<B>Always</B>,
or
<B>NotUseful</B>.
<P>
The <B>backing_planes</B> member is set to indicate (with bits set to 1) which bit 
planes of the window hold dynamic data that must be preserved in backing_stores 
and during save_unders.<BR>
The <B>backing_pixel</B> member is set to indicate what values to use 
for planes not set in backing_planes.

<P>

The save_under member is set to 
<B>True</B>
or
<B>False</B>.

<P>

The <B>colormap</B> member is set to the colormap for the specified window and can be
a colormap ID or 
<B>None</B>.

<P>

The <B>map_installed</B> member is set to indicate whether the colormap is 
currently installed and can be 
<B>True</B>
or
<B>False</B>.

<P>

The <B>map_state</B> member is set to indicate the state of the window and can be
<B>IsUnmapped</B>,
<B>IsUnviewable</B>,
or
<B>IsViewable</B>.
<B>IsUnviewable</B>
is used if the window is mapped but some ancestor is unmapped.

<P>

The <B>all_event_masks</B> member is set to the bitwise inclusive OR of all event 
masks selected on the window by all clients.<BR>
The <B>your_event_mask</B> member is set to the bitwise inclusive OR of all event 
masks selected by the querying client.<BR>
The <B>do_not_propagate_mask</B> member is set to the bitwise inclusive OR of the 
set of events that should not propagate.

<P>

The <B>override_redirect</B> member is set to indicate whether this window overrides
structure control facilities and can be 
<B>True</B>
or
<B>False</B>.
Window manager clients should ignore the window if this member is
<B>True</B>.

<P>

The <B>screen</B> member is set to a screen pointer that gives you a back pointer 
to the correct screen.
This makes it easier to obtain the screen information without
having to loop over the root window fields to see which field matches.

<P>

<B>XGetWindowAttributes()</B>
can generate
<B>BadDrawable</B>
and
<B>BadWindow</B>
errors.

<P>

<H2>Diagnostics</H2>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD><B>BadDrawable</B>
<TD>A value for a Drawable argument does not name a
    defined Window or Pixmap.

<TR><TD><B>BadWindow</B>
<TD>A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
