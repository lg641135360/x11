Hooks onto Xlib Data Structures

<P>

Various Xlib data structures have provisions for extension procedures
to chain extension supplied data onto a list.
These structures are
.PN GC , 
.PN Visual , 
.PN Screen , 
.PN ScreenFormat , 
.PN Display , 
and 
.PN XFontStruct .
Because the list pointer is always the first member in the structure, 
a single set of procedures can be used to manipulate the data
on these lists.

<P>

The following structure is used in the functions in this section
and is defined in 
<B><TT>X11/Xlib.h :</TT></B>

<P>

	int (*free_private)();	/* if defined,  called to free private */
	XPointer private_data;	/* data private to this extension. */
} XExtData;
.De

<P>

.eM
When any of the data structures listed above are freed, 
the list is walked, and the structure's free procedure (if any) is called. 
If free is NULL, 
then the library frees both the data pointed to by the private_data member
and the structure itself.

.eM
The
.PN XEHeadOfExtensionList
function returns a pointer to the list of extension structures attached
to the specified object.
In concert with 
.PN XAddToExtensionList ,
.PN XEHeadOfExtensionList
allows an extension to attach arbitrary data to any of the structures
of types contained in

<P>

.eM
The
.PN XFindOnExtensionList
function returns the first extension data structure
for the extension numbered number.
It is expected that an extension will add at most one extension
data structure to any single data structure's extension data list.
There is no way to find additional structures.

<P>

.eM
This macro is a call through the 
.PN Display
structure to an internal resource ID allocator.
It returns a resource ID that you can use when creating new resources.

<P>

The 
.PN XAllocIDs
macro allocates and returns an array of resource ID.

<P>

.eM
This macro is a call through the 
.PN Display
structure to an internal resource ID allocator.
It returns resource IDs to the array supplied by the caller.
To correctly handle automatic reuse of resource IDs, you must call
.PN XAllocIDs
when requesting multiple resource IDs.  This call might generate
protocol requests.
.SH
GC Caching

<P>

GCs are cached by the library to allow merging of independent change
requests to the same GC into single protocol requests.
This is typically called a write-back cache.
Any extension procedure whose behavior depends on the contents of a GC
must flush the GC cache to make sure the server has up-to-date contents
in its GC.

<P>

The 
.PN FlushGC
macro checks the dirty bits in the library's GC structure and calls
.PN _XFlushGCCache 
if any elements have changed.
The
.PN FlushGC
macro is defined as follows:
<!.IN "FlushGC" "" "@DEF@">
.sM
.FD 0
FlushGC(\fIdisplay\fP, \fIgc\fP)
.br
      Display *\fIdisplay\fP;

      GC \fIgc\fP;
.FN
.IP \fIdisplay\fP 1i
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.IP \fIgc\fP 1i
Specifies the GC.

<P>

.eM
Note that if you extend the GC to add additional resource ID components,
you should ensure that the library stub sends the change request immediately.
This is because a client can free a resource immediately after
using it, so if you only stored the value in the cache without
forcing a protocol request, the resource might be destroyed before being
set into the GC.
You can use the
.PN _XFlushGCCache 
procedure 
to force the cache to be flushed.
The
.PN _XFlushGCCache 
procedure
is defined as follows:
<!.IN "_XFlushGCCache" "" "@DEF@">
.sM
.FD 0
_XFlushGCCache(\fIdisplay\fP, \fIgc\fP)

.SH
Graphics Batching

<P>

If you extend X to add more poly graphics primitives, you may be able to
take advantage of facilities in the library to allow back-to-back 
single calls to be transformed into poly requests.
This may dramatically improve performance of programs that are not
written using poly requests. 
A pointer to an 
.PN xReq ,
called last_req in the display structure, is the last request being processed.  
By checking that the last request
type, drawable, gc, and other options are the same as the new one
and that there is enough space left in the buffer, you may be able
to just extend the previous graphics request by extending the length
field of the request and appending the data to the buffer.  
This can improve performance by five times or more in naive programs.  
For example, here is the source for the 
.PN XDrawPoint 
stub.
(Writing extension stubs is discussed in the next section.)
.IP
.sM
.nf

#include <X11/Xlibint.h>

/* precompute the maximum size of batching request allowed */

static int size = sizeof(xPolyPointReq) + EPERBATCH * sizeof(xPoint);

XDrawPoint(dpy, d, gc, x, y)
    register Display *dpy;
    Drawable d;
    GC gc;
    int x, y; /* INT16 */
{
    xPoint *point;
    LockDisplay(dpy);
    FlushGC(dpy, gc);
    {
    register xPolyPointReq *req = (xPolyPointReq *) dpy->last_req;
    /* if same as previous request, with same drawable, batch requests */
    if (
          (req->reqType == X_PolyPoint)
       && (req->drawable == d)
       && (req->gc == gc->gid)
       && (req->coordMode == CoordModeOrigin)
       && ((dpy->bufptr + sizeof (xPoint)) <= dpy->bufmax)
       && (((char *)dpy->bufptr - (char *)req) < size) ) {
         point = (xPoint *) dpy->bufptr;
         req->length += sizeof (xPoint) >> 2;
         dpy->bufptr += sizeof (xPoint);
         }

    else {
        GetReqExtra(PolyPoint, 4, req); /* 1 point = 4 bytes */
        req->drawable = d;
        req->gc = gc->gid;
        req->coordMode = CoordModeOrigin;
        point = (xPoint *) (req + 1);
        }
    point->x = x;
    point->y = y;
    }
    UnlockDisplay(dpy);
    SyncHandle();
}
.fi

<P>

.eM
To keep clients from generating very long requests that may monopolize the 
server,
there is a symbol defined in
<B><TT>X11/Xlibint.h</TT></B>
of EPERBATCH on the number of requests batched.
Most of the performance benefit occurs in the first few merged requests.
Note that 
.PN FlushGC 
is called \fIbefore\fP picking up the value of last_req,
because it may modify this field.
.SH
Writing Extension Stubs

<P>

All X requests always contain the length of the request,
expressed as a 16-bit quantity of 32 bits.
This means that a single request can be no more than 256K bytes in
length.
Some servers may not support single requests of such a length.
The value of dpy->max_request_size contains the maximum length as
defined by the server implementation.
For further information,
see ``X Window System Protocol.''
.SH
Requests, Replies, and Xproto.h

<P>

The 
<B><TT>X11/Xproto.h</TT></B>
file contains three sets of definitions that
are of interest to the stub implementor:  
request names, request structures, and reply structures.

<P>

You need to generate a file equivalent to 
<B><TT>X11/Xproto.h</TT></B>
for your extension and need to include it in your stub procedure.
Each stub procedure also must include 
<B><TT>X11/Xlibint.h .</TT></B>

<P>

The identifiers are deliberately chosen in such a way that, if the
request is called X_DoSomething, then its request structure is
xDoSomethingReq, and its reply is xDoSomethingReply.  
The GetReq family of macros, defined in 
<B><TT>X11/Xlibint.h , </TT></B>
takes advantage of this naming scheme.

<P>

For each X request, 
there is a definition in 
<B><TT>X11/Xproto.h</TT></B>
that looks similar to this:

<P>

.Ds 
.R
#define X_DoSomething   42
.De
In your extension header file, 
this will be a minor opcode, 
instead of a major opcode.
.SH
Request Format

<P>

Every request contains an 8-bit major opcode and a 16-bit length field
expressed in units of four bytes.  
Every request consists of four bytes of header
(containing the major opcode, the length field, and a data byte) followed by
zero or more additional bytes of data. 
The length field defines the total length of the request, including the header.
The length field in a request must equal the minimum length required to contain 
the request. 
If the specified length is smaller or larger than the required length, 
the server should generate a 
.PN BadLength 
error.
Unused bytes in a request are not required to be zero.  
Extensions should be designed in such a way that long protocol requests
can be split up into smaller requests,
if it is possible to exceed the maximum request size of the server.
The protocol guarantees the maximum request size to be no smaller than
4096 units (16384 bytes).

<P>

Major opcodes 128 through 255 are reserved for extensions.
Extensions are intended to contain multiple requests, 
so extension requests typically have an additional minor opcode encoded 
in the second data byte in the request header, 
but the placement and interpretation of this minor opcode as well as all
other fields in extension requests are not defined by the core protocol.
Every request is implicitly assigned a sequence number (starting with one)
used in replies, errors, and events.

<P>

To help but not cure portability problems to certain machines, the
.PN B16
and
.PN B32
macros have been defined so that they can become bitfield specifications 
on some machines.
For example, on a Cray,
these should be used for all 16-bit and 32-bit quantities, as discussed below.

<P>

Most protocol requests have a corresponding structure typedef in
<B><TT>X11/Xproto.h ,</TT></B>
which looks like:

<P>

<!.IN "xDoSomethingReq" "" "@DEF@">
.sM
.Ds 0
.TA .5i 3i
.ta .5i 3i
typedef struct _DoSomethingReq {
	CARD8 reqType;	/* X_DoSomething */
	CARD8 someDatum;	/* used differently in different requests */
	CARD16 length B16;	/* total # of bytes in request, divided by 4 */
	...
	/* request-specific data */
	...
} xDoSomethingReq;
.De

<P>

.eM
If a core protocol request has a single 32-bit argument, 
you need not declare a request structure in your extension header file.
Instead, such requests use the
.PN xResourceReq
structure in
<B><TT>X11/Xproto.h .</TT></B>
This structure is used for any request whose single argument is a 
.PN Window , 
.PN Pixmap ,
.PN Drawable , 
.PN GContext , 
.PN Font , 
.PN Cursor , 
.PN Colormap , 
.PN Atom , 
or
.PN VisualID .

<P>

<!.IN "xResourceReq" "" "@DEF@">
.sM
.Ds 0
.TA .5i 3i
.ta .5i 3i
typedef struct _ResourceReq {
	CARD8 reqType;	/* the request type, e.g. X_DoSomething */
	BYTE pad;	/* not used */
	CARD16 length B16;	/* 2 (= total # of bytes in request, divided by 4) */
	CARD32 id B32;	/* the Window, Drawable, Font, GContext, etc. */
} xResourceReq;
.De

<P>

.eM
If convenient,
you can do something similar in your extension header file. 

<P>

In both of these structures, 
the reqType field identifies the type of the request (for example, 
X_MapWindow or X_CreatePixmap).  
The length field tells how long the request is
in units of 4-byte longwords. 
This length includes both the request structure itself and any
variable length data, such as strings or lists, that follow the
request structure.  
Request structures come in different sizes, 
but all requests are padded to be multiples of four bytes long.

<P>

A few protocol requests take no arguments at all. 
Instead, they use the
.PN xReq 
structure in
<B><TT>X11/Xproto.h ,</TT></B>
which contains only a reqType and a length (and a pad byte).

<P>
 
If the protocol request requires a reply, 
then
<B><TT>X11/Xproto.h</TT></B>
also contains a reply structure typedef:

<P>

<!.IN "xDoSomethingReply" "" "@DEF@">
.sM
.Ds 0
.TA .5i 3i
.ta .5i 3i
typedef struct _DoSomethingReply {
	BYTE type;	/* always X_Reply */
	BYTE someDatum;	/* used differently in different requests */
	CARD16 sequenceNumber B16;	/* # of requests sent so far */
	CARD32 length B32;	/* # of additional bytes, divided by 4 */
	...
	/* request-specific data */
	...
} xDoSomethingReply;
.De

<P>

.eM
Most of these reply structures are 32 bytes long. 
If there are not that many reply values, 
then they contain a sufficient number of pad fields
to bring them up to 32 bytes.  
The length field is the total number of bytes in the request minus 32, 
divided by 4.  
This length will be nonzero only if:
.IP \(bu 5
The reply structure is followed by variable length
data such as a list or string.
.IP \(bu 5
The reply structure is longer than 32 bytes.

<P>

Only 
.PN GetWindowAttributes , 
.PN QueryFont , 
.PN QueryKeymap , 
and
.PN GetKeyboardControl 
have reply structures longer than 32 bytes in the core protocol.

<P>

A few protocol requests return replies that contain no data.  
<B><TT>X11/Xproto.h</TT></B>
does not define reply structures for these.
Instead, they use the 
.PN xGenericReply
structure, which contains only a type, length,
and sequence number (and sufficient padding to make it 32 bytes long).
.SH
Starting to Write a Stub Procedure

<P>

An Xlib stub procedure should start like this:

<P>

.Ds 
.R
#include "<X11/Xlibint.h>

XDoSomething (arguments, ... )
/* argument declarations */
{

register XDoSomethingReq *req;
...
.De
If the protocol request has a reply, 
then the variable declarations should include the reply structure for the request.
The following is an example:

<P>

.Ds 
.R
xDoSomethingReply rep;
.De 
.SH
Locking Data Structures

<P>

To lock the display structure for systems that
want to support multithreaded access to a single display connection,
each stub will need to lock its critical section.
Generally, this section is the point from just before the appropriate GetReq
call until all arguments to the call have been stored into the buffer.
The precise instructions needed for this locking depend upon the machine
architecture. 
Two calls, which are generally implemented as macros, have been provided.
<!.IN "LockDisplay" "" "@DEF@">
.sM

.IP \fIdisplay\fP 1i

<P>

.eM
.SH
Sending the Protocol Request and Arguments

<P>

After the variable declarations, 
a stub procedure should call one of four macros defined in 
<B><TT>X11/Xlibint.h : </TT></B>
.PN GetReq , 
.PN GetReqExtra , 
.PN GetResReq , 
or 
.PN GetEmptyReq .  
All of these macros take, as their first argument,
the name of the protocol request as declared in 
<B><TT>X11/Xproto.h</TT></B>
except with X_ removed.   
Each one declares a 
.PN Display 
structure pointer,
called dpy, and a pointer to a request structure, called req,
which is of the appropriate type.
The macro then appends the request structure to the output buffer, 
fills in its type and length field, and sets req to point to it.

<P>

If the protocol request has no arguments (for instance, X_GrabServer),
then use 
.PN GetEmptyReq .

<P>

.Ds
.R 
GetEmptyReq (DoSomething, req);
.De
If the protocol request has a single 32-bit argument (such as a
.PN Pixmap , 
.PN Window , 
.PN Drawable , 
.PN Atom , 
and so on),
then use 
.PN GetResReq .  
The second argument to the macro is the 32-bit object.  
.PN X_MapWindow 
is a good example.

<P>

.Ds
.R
GetResReq (DoSomething, rid, req);
.De
The rid argument is the 
.PN Pixmap , 
.PN Window , 
or other resource ID.

<P>

If the protocol request takes any other argument list, 
then call 
.PN GetReq .  
After the 
.PN GetReq , 
you need to set all the other fields in the request structure,
usually from arguments to the stub procedure.

<P>

.Ds 
.R
GetReq (DoSomething, req);
/* fill in arguments here */
req->arg1 = arg1;
req->arg2 = arg2;
...
.De
A few stub procedures (such as 
.PN XCreateGC 
and 
.PN XCreatePixmap ) 
return a resource ID to the caller but pass a resource ID as an argument
to the protocol request.   
Such procedures use the macro 
.PN XAllocID 
to allocate a resource ID from the range of IDs 
that were assigned to this client when it opened the connection.

<P>

.Ds 
.R
rid = req->rid = XAllocID();
...
return (rid);
.De
Finally, some stub procedures transmit a fixed amount of variable length
data after the request.  
Typically, these procedures (such as
.PN XMoveWindow 
and 
.PN XSetBackground ) 
are special cases of more general functions like 
.PN XMoveResizeWindow 
and 
.PN XChangeGC .   
These procedures use 
.PN GetReqExtra , 
which is the same as 
.PN GetReq
except that it takes an additional argument (the number of
extra bytes to allocate in the output buffer after the request structure).  
This number should always be a multiple of four.
.SH
Variable Length Arguments

<P>

Some protocol requests take additional variable length data that
follow the 
.PN xDoSomethingReq 
structure.    
The format of this data varies from request to request. 
Some requests require a sequence of 8-bit bytes, 
others a sequence of 16-bit or 32-bit entities, 
and still others a sequence of structures.

<P>

It is necessary to add the length of any variable length data to the
length field of the request structure.  
That length field is in units of 32-bit longwords.  
If the data is a string or other sequence of 8-bit bytes, 
then you must round the length up and shift it before adding:

<P>

.Ds
.R
req->length += (nbytes+3)>>2;
.De
To transmit variable length data, use the 
.PN Data 
macros.
If the data fits into the output buffer, 
then this macro copies it to the buffer.  
If it does not fit, however,
the 
.PN Data 
macro calls 
.PN _XSend , 
which transmits first the contents of the buffer and then your data.
The 
.PN Data 
macros take three arguments:  
the display, a pointer to the beginning of the data, 
and the number of bytes to be sent.
.sM
.FD 0
Data(\fIdisplay\fP, (char *) \fIdata\fP, \fInbytes\fP);
.sp
Data16(\fIdisplay\fP, (short *) \fIdata\fP, \fInbytes\fP);
.sp
Data32(\fIdisplay\fP, (long *) \fIdata\fP, \fInbytes\fP);
.FN

<P>

.eM
.PN Data ,
.PN Data16 ,
and
.PN Data32
are macros that may use their last argument
more than once, so that argument should be a variable rather than
an expression such as ``nitems*sizeof(item)''.  
You should do that kind of computation in a separate statement before calling 
them.
Use the appropriate macro when sending byte, short, or long data.

<P>

If the protocol request requires a reply, 
then call the procedure 
.PN _XSend 
instead of the 
.PN Data 
macro.  
.PN _XSend 
takes the same arguments, but because it sends your data immediately instead of 
copying it into the output buffer (which would later be flushed
anyway by the following call on 
.PN _XReply ), 
it is faster.
.SH
Replies

<P>

If the protocol request has a reply, 
then call 
.PN _XReply 
after you have finished dealing with 
all the fixed and variable length arguments.  
.PN _XReply 
flushes the output buffer and waits for an 
.PN xReply 
packet to arrive.  
If any events arrive in the meantime,
.PN _XReply 
places them in the queue for later use.

.eM
The
.PN _XReply 
function waits for a reply packet and copies its contents into the
specified rep.  
.PN _XReply 
handles error and event packets that occur before the reply is received.
.PN _XReply 
takes four arguments:
.IP \(bu 5
A 
.PN Display

.IP \(bu 5
A pointer to a reply structure (which must be cast to an 
.PN xReply 
*)
.IP \(bu 5
The number of additional 32-bit words (beyond 
.Pn sizeof( xReply ) 
= 32 bytes)
in the reply structure
.IP \(bu 5
A Boolean that indicates whether
.PN _XReply 
is to discard any additional bytes
beyond those it was told to read

<P>

Because most reply structures are 32 bytes long, 
the third argument is usually 0.  
The only core protocol exceptions are the replies to 
.PN GetWindowAttributes , 
.PN QueryFont , 
.PN QueryKeymap , 
and 
.PN GetKeyboardControl ,
which have longer replies.

<P>

The last argument should be 
.PN False 
if the reply structure is followed
by additional variable length data (such as a list or string).  
It should be 
.PN True 
if there is not any variable length data.
.NT
This last argument is provided for upward-compatibility reasons
to allow a client to communicate properly with a hypothetical later
version of the server that sends more data than the client expected.
For example, some later version of 
.PN GetWindowAttributes 
might use a
larger, but compatible, 
.PN xGetWindowAttributesReply 
that contains additional attribute data at the end.
.NE
.PN _XReply 
returns 
.PN True
if it received a reply successfully or 
.PN False 
if it received any sort of error. 

<P>

For a request with a reply that is not followed by variable length
data, you write something like:

<P>

.Ds 
.R
_XReply(display, (xReply *)&rep, 0, True);
*ret1 = rep.ret1;
*ret2 = rep.ret2;
*ret3 = rep.ret3;
...
UnlockDisplay(dpy);
SyncHandle();
return (rep.ret4);
}
.De
If there is variable length data after the reply, 
change the 
.PN True 
to 
.PN False , 
and use the appropriate
.PN _XRead 
function to read the variable length data.

Each protocol request is a little different. 
For further information,
see the Xlib sources for examples.
.SH
Synchronous Calling

<P>

Each procedure should have a call, just before returning to the user, 
to a macro called
.PN SyncHandle .
If synchronous mode is enabled (see 
.PN XSynchronize ), 
the request is sent immediately.
The library, however, waits until any error the procedure could generate
at the server has been handled.
.SH
Allocating and Deallocating Memory

<P>

To support the possible reentry of these procedures, 
you must observe several conventions when allocating and deallocating memory,
most often done when returning data to the user from the window
system of a size the caller could not know in advance
(for example, a list of fonts or a list of extensions).
The standard C library functions on many systems
are not protected against signals or other multithreaded uses.
The following analogies to standard I/O library functions
have been defined:
.TS
l l.
T{
.PN Xmalloc ()
T}	T{
Replaces 
.PN malloc ()
T}
T{
.PN XFree ()
T}	T{
Replaces 
.PN free ()
T}
T{
.PN Xcalloc ()
T}	T{
Replaces 
.PN calloc ()
T}
.TE

<P>

These should be used in place of any calls you would make to the normal
C library functions.

<P>

If you need a single scratch buffer inside a critical section 
(for example, to pack and unpack data to and from the wire protocol),
the general memory allocators may be too expensive to use
(particularly in output functions, which are performance critical).  
The following function returns a scratch buffer for use within a
critical section:
<!.IN "_XAllocScratch" "" "@DEF@">
.sM
.FD 0
char *_XAllocScratch(\fIdisplay\fP, \fInbytes\fP)
.br

<P>

.eM
This storage must only be used inside of a critical section of your
stub.  The returned pointer cannot be assumed valid after any call
that might permit another thread to execute inside Xlib.  For example,
the pointer cannot be assumed valid after any use of the

or
.PN Data
families of macros,
after any use of
.PN _XReply ,
or after any use of the
.PN _XSend
or
.PN _XRead

Portability Considerations

<P>

Many machine architectures, 
including many of the more recent RISC architectures, 
do not correctly access data at unaligned locations; 
their compilers pad out structures to preserve this characteristic.
Many other machines capable of unaligned references pad inside of structures
as well to preserve alignment, because accessing aligned data is
usually much faster.
Because the library and the server use structures to access data at
arbitrary points in a byte stream,
all data in request and reply packets \fImust\fP be naturally aligned;
that is, 16-bit data starts on 16-bit boundaries in the request
and 32-bit data on 32-bit boundaries.
All requests \fImust\fP be a multiple of 32 bits in length to preserve
the natural alignment in the data stream.
You must pad structures out to 32-bit boundaries.
Pad information does not have to be zeroed unless you want to
preserve such fields for future use in your protocol requests.
Floating point varies radically between machines and should be
avoided completely if at all possible.

<P>

This code may run on machines with 16-bit ints.  
So, if any integer argument, variable, or return value either can take 
only nonnegative values or is declared as a
.PN CARD16
in the protocol, be sure to declare it as
.PN unsigned
.PN int
and not as
.PN int .
(This, of course, does not apply to Booleans or enumerations.)

<P>

Similarly, 
if any integer argument or return value is declared
.PN CARD32
in the protocol, 
declare it as an
.PN unsigned
.PN long
and not as
.PN int
or
.PN long .
This also goes for any internal variables that may
take on values larger than the maximum 16-bit
.PN unsigned
.PN int .

<P>

The library currently assumes that a
.PN char
is 8 bits, a
.PN short
is 16 bits, an
.PN int
is 16 or 32 bits, and a
.PN long
is 32 bits.  
The 
.PN PackData 
macro is a half-hearted attempt to deal with the possibility of 32 bit shorts. 
However, much more work is needed to make this work properly.
.SH
Deriving the Correct Extension Opcode

<P>

The remaining problem a writer of an extension stub procedure faces that
the core protocol does not face is to map from the call to the proper
major and minor opcodes.  
While there are a number of strategies, 
the simplest and fastest is outlined below.
.IP 1. 5
Declare an array of pointers, _NFILE long (this is normally found
in 
<B><TT>stdio.h</TT></B>
and is the number of file descriptors supported on the system)
of type 
.PN XExtCodes .
Make sure these are all initialized to NULL.
.IP 2. 5
When your stub is entered, your initialization test is just to use
the display pointer passed in to access the file descriptor and an index
into the array.  
If the entry is NULL, then this is the first time you
are entering the procedure for this display.  
Call your initialization procedure and pass to it the display pointer.
.IP 3. 5
Once in your initialization procedure, call 
.PN XInitExtension ;
if it succeeds, store the pointer returned into this array.  
Make sure to establish a close display handler to allow you to zero the entry.
Do whatever other initialization your extension requires.
(For example, install event handlers and so on.)
Your initialization procedure would normally return a pointer to the
.PN XExtCodes 
structure for this extension, which is what would normally
be found in your array of pointers.
.IP 4. 5
After returning from your initialization procedure, 
the stub can now continue normally, because it has its major opcode safely 
in its hand in the 
.PN XExtCodes 
structure.
