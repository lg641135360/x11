<H1 ALIGN=center>Appendix C: Extensions</H1>

Because X can evolve by extensions to the core protocol, 
it is important that extensions not be perceived as second class citizens.
At some point, 
your favorite extensions may be adopted as additional parts of the 
X Standard.

<P>

Therefore, there should be little to distinguish the use of an extension from 
that of the core protocol.
To avoid having to initialize extensions explicitly in application programs, 
it is also important that extensions perform lazy evaluations,
automatically initializing themselves when called for the first time.  

<P>

This appendix describes techniques for writing extensions to Xlib that will
run at essentially the same performance as the core protocol requests.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is expected that a given extension to X consists of multiple
requests.
Defining ten new features as ten separate extensions is a bad practice.
Rather, they should be packaged into a single extension
and should use minor opcodes to distinguish the requests.
