<H1 ALIGN=center>Hooking into Xlib </H1>

These functions allow you to hook into the library.  
They are not normally used by application programmers but are used 
by people who need to extend the core X protocol and
the X library interface.
The functions, which generate protocol requests for X, are typically
called stubs.

<P>

In extensions, stubs first should check to see if they have initialized 
themselves on a connection.
If they have not, they then should call 
<B><A HREF="XInitExtension.html">XInitExtension()</A></B>
to attempt to initialize themselves on the connection.

<P>

If the extension needs to be informed of GC/font allocation or
deallocation or if the extension defines new event types, 
the functions described here allow the extension to be 
called when these events occur.

<A NAME="XExtCodes"></A>
<P>

The
<B>XExtCodes</B>
structure returns the information from 
<B><A HREF="XInitExtension.html">XInitExtension()</A></B>
and is defined in
<B><TT>X11/Xlib.h : </TT></B>

<P>

<!.IN "XExtCodes" "" "@DEF@">

typedef struct _XExtCodes {	/* public to extension, cannot be changed */
	int extension;	/* extension number */
	int major_opcode;	/* major op-code assigned by server */
	int first_event;	/* first event number for the extension */
	int first_error;	/* first error number for the extension */
} XExtCodes;
