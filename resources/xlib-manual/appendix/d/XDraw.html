<H2>Arguments</H2>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD> <B>display</B>
<TD> Specifies the connection to the X server.

<TR><TD> <B>d</B>
<TD> Specifies the drawable. 

<TR><TD> <B>gc</B>
<TD> Specifies the GC.

<TR><TD> <B>vlist</B>
<TD> Specifies a pointer to the list of vertices that indicate what to draw.

<TR><TD> <B>vcount</B>
<TD> Specifies how many vertices are in vlist.

</TABLE>

<H2>Description</H2>

The
<B>XDraw()</B>
function draws an arbitrary polygon or curve.  
The figure drawn is defined by the specified list of vertices (vlist).
The points are connected by lines as specified in the flags in the
vertex structure.

<A NAME="Vertex"></A>
<P>

Each Vertex, as defined in
<B><TT>X11/X10.h</TT></B>,
is a structure with the following members:

<P>

<!.IN "Vertex" "" "@DEF@">
<CODE><PRE>
typedef struct _Vertex {
	short x,y;
	unsigned short flags;
} Vertex;
</PRE></CODE>

<P>

The x and y members are the coordinates of the vertex 
that are relative to either the upper-left inside corner of the drawable 
(if 
<B>VertexRelative</B>
is zero) or the previous vertex (if 
<B>VertexRelative</B>
is one).

<P>

The flags, as defined in 
<B><TT>X11/X10.h , </TT></B>
are as follows:
<!.IN "VertexRelative" "" "@DEF@">
<!.IN "VertexDontDraw" "" "@DEF@">
<!.IN "VertexCurved" "" "@DEF@">
<!.IN "VertexStartClosed" "" "@DEF@">
<!.IN "VertexEndClosed" "" "@DEF@">

<CODE><PRE>
<B>VertexRelative</B>	0x0001	/* else absolute */
<B>VertexDontDraw</B>	0x0002	/* else draw */
<B>VertexCurved</B>	0x0004	/* else straight */
<B>VertexStartClosed</B>	0x0008	/* else not */
<B>VertexEndClosed</B>	0x0010	/* else not */
</PRE></CODE>

<P>

<UL>

<P><LI>
If 
<B>VertexRelative</B>
is not set,  
the coordinates are absolute (that is, relative to the drawable's origin).  
The first vertex must be an absolute vertex.

<P><LI>
If
<B>VertexDontDraw</B>
is one, 
no line or curve is drawn from the previous vertex to this one.  
This is analogous to picking up the pen and moving to another place 
before drawing another line.

<P><LI>
If 
<B>VertexCurved</B>
is one, 
a spline algorithm is used to draw a smooth curve from the previous vertex
through this one to the next vertex.  
Otherwise, a straight line is drawn from the previous vertex to this one.  
It makes sense to set 
<B>VertexCurved</B>
to one only if a previous and next vertex are both defined
(either explicitly in the array or through the definition of a closed 
curve).

<P><LI>
It is permissible for 
<B>VertexDontDraw</B>
bits and 
<B>VertexCurved</B>
bits both to be one. 
This is useful if you want to define the previous point for the smooth curve
but do not want an actual curve drawing to start until this point.

<P><LI>
If 
<B>VertexStartClosed</B>
is one, 
then this point marks the beginning of a closed curve.  
This vertex must be followed later in the array by another vertex 
whose effective coordinates are identical
and that has a
<B>VertexEndClosed</B>
bit of one.
The points in between form a cycle to determine predecessor 
and successor vertices for the spline algorithm.

</UL>
<P>

This function uses these GC components:
function, plane-mask, line-width, line-style, cap-style, join-style,
fill-style, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and
clip-mask.
It also uses these GC mode-dependent components: 
foreground, background, tile, stipple,
tile-stipple-x-origin, tile-stipple-y-origin, dash-offset, and dash-list.
