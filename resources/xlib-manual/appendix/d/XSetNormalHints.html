<H2>Syntax</H2>

<CODE><PRE>
XSetNormalHints(<B>display</B>, <B>w</B>, <B>hints</B>)
      Display *<B>display</B>;
      Window <B>w</B>;

<H2>Arguments</H2>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD> <B>display</B>
<TD> Specifies the connection to the X server.

<TR><TD> <B>w</B>
<TD> Specifies the window.

<TR><TD> <B>hints</B>
<TD> Specifies a pointer to the size hints for the window in its normal state.

</TABLE>

<H2>Description</H2>

The
<B>XSetNormalHints()</B>
function sets the size hints structure for the specified window.
Applications use
<B>XSetNormalHints()</B>
to inform the window manager of the size
or position desirable for that window.
In addition, 
an application that wants to move or resize itself should call
<B>XSetNormalHints()</B>
and specify its new desired location and size
as well as making direct Xlib calls to move or resize.  
This is because window managers may ignore redirected
configure requests, but they pay attention to property changes.

<P>

To set size hints, 
an application not only must assign values to the appropriate members
in the hints structure but also must set the flags member of the structure 
to indicate which information is present and where it came from.  
A call to
<B>XSetNormalHints()</B>
is meaningless, unless the flags member is set to indicate which members of
the structure have been assigned values.

<P>

<B>XSetNormalHints()</B>
can generate
<B>BadAlloc</B>
and
<B>BadWindow</B> 
errors.

<H2>Syntax</H2>

<H2>Diagnostics</H2>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD><B>BadAlloc</B>
<TD> The server failed to allocate the requested
     source or server memory.

<TR><TD><B>BadWindow</B>
<TD>A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
