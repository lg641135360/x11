<H1 ALIGN=center>9.8 Controlling Host Access</H1>

<P>

This section discusses how to:

<UL>
<P><LI>
<A HREF="hosts.html">Add, get, or remove hosts from the access control list</A>

<P><LI>
<A HREF="access.html">Change, enable, or disable access</A>
</UL>

<P>

<!.IN "Access control list">
<!.IN "Authentication">
X does not provide any protection on a per-window basis.
If you find out the resource ID of a resource, you can manipulate it.
To provide some minimal level of protection, however,
connections are permitted only from machines you trust.
This is adequate on single-user workstations but obviously
breaks down on timesharing machines.
Although provisions exist in the X protocol for proper connection
authentication, the lack of a standard authentication server
leaves host-level access control as the only common mechanism.

<P>

<!.IN "Default Protection">
The initial set of hosts allowed to open connections typically consists of:

<UL>
<P><LI>
The host the window system is running on.

<P><LI>
On POSIX-conformant systems, each host listed in the
<B>/etc/X?.hosts</B>
file.
The ? indicates the number of the
display.
<!.IN "Files" "/etc/X?.hosts">
This file should consist of host names separated by newlines.
DECnet nodes must terminate in :: to distinguish them from Internet hosts.
</UL>

<P>

If a host is not in the access control list when the access control 
mechanism is enabled and if the host attempts to establish a connection,
the server refuses the connection.
To change the access list,
the client must reside on the same host as the server and/or must
have been granted permission in the initial authorization at connection
setup.

<P>

Servers also can implement other access control policies in addition to
or in place of this host access facility.
For further information about other access control implementations,
see ``X Window System Protocol.''
