<H1 ALIGN=center>9.3 Managing Installed Colormaps</H1>

The X server maintains a list of installed colormaps.
Windows using these colormaps are guaranteed to display with
correct colors; windows using other colormaps may or may not display
with correct colors.
Xlib provides functions that you can use to install a colormap, 
uninstall a colormap, and obtain a list of installed colormaps.

<P>

At any time,
there is a subset of the installed maps that is viewed as an ordered list
and is called the required list.
The length of the required list is at most M,
where M is the minimum number of installed colormaps specified for the screen
in the connection setup.
The required list is maintained as follows.
When a colormap is specified to
<B><A HREF="XInstallColormap.html">XInstallColormap()</A></B>,
it is added to the head of the list;
the list is truncated at the tail, if necessary, to keep its length to 
at most M.
When a colormap is specified to
<B><A HREF="XUninstallColormap.html">XUninstallColormap()</A></B>
and it is in the required list,
it is removed from the list.
A colormap is not added to the required list when it is implicitly installed
by the X server,
and the X server cannot implicitly uninstall a colormap that is in the
required list.

<P>

To install a colormap, use
<B><A HREF="XInstallColormap.html">XInstallColormap()</A></B>.

<P>

To uninstall a colormap, use
<B><A HREF="XUninstallColormap.html">XUninstallColormap()</A></B>.

<P>

To obtain a list of the currently installed colormaps for a given screen, use
<B><A HREF="XListInstalledColormaps.html">XListInstalledColormaps()</A></B>.
