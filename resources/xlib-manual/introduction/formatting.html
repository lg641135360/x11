<H1 ALIGN=center>1.8. Formatting Conventions</H1>

<I>Xlib --- C Language X Interface</I> uses the following conventions:

<UL>
<P><LI>
This HTML version of the manual uses formatting conventions that are
slighty different of the original (troff) manual:

<P>

Global symbols are either printed in 
<B>bold</B>, either hyperlinked or both. Functions name are printed in
bold, suffixed with () and hyperlinked to their definition
page. Symbols define in include files are rendered with a <B>bold</B>
typeface. Structure names are printed in regular type and are
hyperlinked to their definition.

When declared and defined,
function arguments are printed in <B>bold</B>, and also in the following explanatory text.

<P><LI>
Each function is introduced by a general discussion that 
distinguishes it from other functions.
The function declaration itself follows,
and each argument is specifically explained.
Although ANSI C function prototype syntax is not used,
Xlib header files normally declare functions using function prototypes
in ANSI C environments.
General discussion of the function, if any is required,
follows the arguments.
Where applicable, 
the last paragraph of the explanation lists the possible 
Xlib error codes that the function can generate.
For a complete discussion of the Xlib error codes,
see "<A HREF="../event-handling/protocol-errors/default-handlers.html">Using the Default Error Handlers</A>".

<P><LI>
To eliminate any ambiguity between those arguments that you pass and those that 
a function returns to you,
the explanations for all arguments that you pass start with the word
<I>specifies</I> or, in the case of multiple arguments, the word <I>specify</I>.
The explanations for all arguments that are returned to you start with the
word <I>returns</I> or, in the case of multiple arguments, the word <I>return</I>.
The explanations for all arguments that you can pass and are returned start
with the words <I>specifies and returns</I>.

<P><LI>
Any pointer to a structure that is used to return a value is designated as 
such by the <I>_return</I> suffix as part of its name.
All other pointers passed to these functions are
used for reading only.
A few arguments use pointers to structures that are used for
both input and output and are indicated by using the <I>_in_out</I> suffix.
