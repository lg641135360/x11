Some functions return 
<B>Status</B>, 
an integer error indication.
If the function fails, it returns a zero.
If the function returns a status of zero,
it has not updated the return arguments.
<!.IN "Status">
Because C does not provide multiple return values, 
many functions must return their results by writing into client-passed storage. 
<!.IN "Error" "handling">
By default, errors are handled either by a standard library function
or by one that you provide.
Functions that return pointers to strings return NULL pointers if
the string does not exist.

<P>

The X server reports protocol errors at the time that it detects them.
If more than one error could be generated for a given request,
the server can report any of them.

<P>

Because Xlib usually does not transmit requests to the server immediately
(that is, it buffers them), errors can be reported much later than they
actually occur.
For debugging purposes, however,
Xlib provides a mechanism for forcing synchronous behavior 
(see "<A HREF="../event-handling/protocol-errors/synchronization.html">Enabling or Disabling Synchronization</A>").
When synchronization is enabled, 
errors are reported as they are generated.

<P>

When Xlib detects an error,
it calls an error handler,
which your program can provide.
If you do not provide an error handler,
the error is printed, and your program terminates.
