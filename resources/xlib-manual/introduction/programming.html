<H1 ALIGN=center>1.6. Programming Considerations</H1>

The major programming considerations are:

<UL>
<P><LI>
Coordinates and sizes in X are actually 16-bit quantities.
This decision was made to minimize the bandwidth required for a
given level of performance.
Coordinates usually are declared as an
<B>int</B> 
in the interface.
Values larger than 16 bits are truncated silently.
Sizes (width and height) are declared as unsigned quantities.

<P><LI>
Keyboards are the greatest variable between different
manufacturers' workstations.
If you want your program to be portable,
you should be particularly conservative here.

<P><LI>
Many display systems have limited amounts of off-screen memory.
If you can, you should minimize use of pixmaps and backing
store.

<P><LI>
The user should have control of his screen real estate.
Therefore, you should write your applications to react to window management
rather than presume control of the entire screen.
What you do inside of your top-level window, however,
is up to your application.
