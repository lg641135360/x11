<H1 ALIGN=center>1.1. Overview of the X Window System</H1>

<P>

Some of the terms used in this book are unique to X,
and other terms that are common to other window systems 
have different meanings in X.
You may find it helpful to refer to the <A HREF="../glossary/">glossary</A>, 
which is located at the end of the book.

<P>

The X Window System supports one or more screens containing
overlapping windows or subwindows.
A <B>screen</B> is a physical monitor and hardware,
which can be either color, grayscale, or monochrome.
There can be multiple screens for each display or workstation.
A single X server can provide display services for any number of screens.
A set of screens for a single user with one keyboard and one pointer
(usually a mouse) is called a display.

<P>

<!.IN "Screen">
All the windows in an X server are arranged in strict hierarchies.
At the top of each hierarchy is a root window,
which covers each of the display screens.
Each root window is partially or completely covered by child windows.
All windows, except for root windows, have parents.
There is usually at least one window for each application program.
<!.IN "Child window">
<!.IN "Parent Window">
Child windows may in turn have their own children.
In this way, 
an application program can create an arbitrarily deep tree 
on each screen.
X provides graphics, text, and raster operations for windows.

<P>

A child window can be larger than its parent. 
That is, part or all of
the child window can extend beyond the boundaries of the parent,
but all output to a window is clipped by its parent.
<!.IN "Stacking order">
If several children of a window have overlapping locations, 
one of the children is considered to be on top of or raised over the
others thus obscuring them.
Output to areas covered by other windows is suppressed by the window
system unless the window has backing store.
If a window is obscured by a second window, 
the second window obscures only those ancestors of the second window,
which are also ancestors of the first window.

<P>

<!.IN "Window" "" "@DEF@">
A window has a border zero or more pixels in width, which can
be any pattern (pixmap) or solid color you like.
A window usually but not always has a background pattern,
which will be repainted by the window system when uncovered.
Child windows obscure their parents,
and graphic operations in the parent window usually
are clipped by the children.

<P>

Each window and pixmap has its own coordinate system.
The coordinate system has the X axis horizontal and the Y axis vertical
with the origin [0, 0] at the upper-left corner.
Coordinates are integral,
in terms of pixels,
and coincide with pixel centers.
For a window, 
the origin is inside the border at the inside, upper-left corner.

<P>

X does not guarantee to preserve the contents of windows. 
When part or all of a window is hidden and then brought back onto the screen,
its contents may be lost. 
The server then sends the client program an
<B><A HREF="../events/exposure/expose.html">Expose</A></B>
event to notify it that part or all of the window needs to be repainted.
Programs must be prepared to regenerate the contents of windows on demand.

<P>

<!.IN "Pixmap">
<!.IN "Drawable">
<!.IN "Tile">
<!.IN "Bitmap">
X also provides off-screen storage of graphics objects,
called pixmaps.
Single plane (depth 1) pixmaps are sometimes referred to as bitmaps.
Pixmaps can be used in most graphics functions interchangeably with
windows and are used in various graphics operations to define patterns or tiles.
Windows and pixmaps together are referred to as drawables.

<P>

Most of the functions in Xlib just add requests to an output buffer.
These requests later execute asynchronously on the X server.
Functions that return values of information stored in
the server do not return (that is, they block)
until an explicit reply is received or an error occurs.
You can provide an error handler,
which will be called when the error is reported.

<P>

<!.IN "XSync">
If a client does not want a request to execute asynchronously, 
it can follow the request with a call to 
<B><A HREF="../event-handling/XSync.html">XSync()</A></B> , 
which blocks until all previously buffered
asynchronous events have been sent and acted on.
As an important side effect, 
the output buffer in Xlib is always flushed by a call to any function
that returns a value from the server or waits for input.

<A NAME="XID"></A>
<P>

<!.IN "Resource IDs">
<!.IN "Resource IDs" "Window">
<!.IN "Resource IDs" "Font">
<!.IN "Resource IDs" "Pixmap">
<!.IN "Resource IDs" "Cursor">
<!.IN "Resource IDs" "GContext">
Many Xlib functions will return an integer resource ID,
which allows you to refer to objects stored on the X server.
These can be of type 
<B>Window</B>, 
<B>Font</B>, 
<B>Pixmap</B>, 
<B>Colormap</B>,
<B>Cursor</B>, 
and 
<B>GContext</B>,
as defined in the file
<TT>&lt;X11/X.h&gt;</TT>.
These resources are created by requests and are destroyed
(or freed) by requests or when connections are closed.
Most of these resources are potentially sharable between
applications, and in fact, windows are manipulated explicitly by
window manager programs.
Fonts and cursors are shared automatically across multiple screens.
Fonts are loaded and unloaded as needed and are shared by multiple clients.
Fonts are often cached in the server.
Xlib provides no support for sharing graphics contexts between applications.

<P>

<!.IN "Event">
Client programs are informed of events.
Events may either be side effects of a request (for example, restacking windows
generates 
<B><A HREF="../events/exposure/expose.html">Expose</A></B> 
events) or completely asynchronous (for example, from the keyboard).
A client program asks to be informed of events.
Because other applications can send events to your application,
programs must be prepared to handle (or ignore) events of all types.

<P>

Input events (for example, a key pressed or the pointer moved) 
arrive asynchronously from the server and are queued until they are 
requested by an explicit call (for example,
<B><A HREF="../event-handling/manipulating-event-queue/XNextEvent.html">XNextEvent()</A></B>
or
<B><A HREF="../event-handling/manipulating-event-queue/XWindowEvent.html">XWindowEvent()</A></B>).
In addition, some library
functions (for example,
<B><A HREF="../window/XRaiseWindow.html">XRaiseWindow()</A></B>)
generate 
<B><A HREF="../events/exposure/expose.html">Expose</A></B>
and
<B><A HREF="../events/structure-control/configure.html">ConfigureRequest</A></B>
events.
These events also arrive asynchronously, but the client may
<!.IN "XSync">
wish to explicitly wait for them by calling
<B><A HREF="../event-handling/XSync.html">XSync()</A></B>
after calling a function that can cause the server to generate events.
