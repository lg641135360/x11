<H1 ALIGN=center>1.3. Standard Header Files</H1>
<P>

The following include files are part of the Xlib standard:
<UL>
<P><LI>
<B><TT>X11/Xlib.h</TT></B>

<P>

This is the main header file for Xlib.
The majority of all Xlib symbols are declared by including this file.
This file also contains the preprocessor symbol
<B>XlibSpecificationRelease</B>.
<!.IN "XlibSpecificationRelease" "" "@DEF@">
This symbol is defined to have the 6 in this release of the standard.
(Release 5 of Xlib was the first release to have this symbol.)
<P><LI>
<B><TT>X11/X.h</TT></B>

<P>

This file declares types and constants for the X protocol that are
to be used by applications.
It is included automatically from
<B><TT>X11/Xlib.h</TT></B>,
so application code should never need to reference this file directly.
<P><LI>
<B><TT>X11/Xcms.h</TT></B>

<P>

This file contains symbols for much of the color management facilities
described in "<A HREF="../color/">Color Management Functions</A>".
All functions, types, and symbols with the prefix ``Xcms'',
plus the Color Conversion Contexts macros, are declared in this file.
<B><TT>X11/Xlib.h</TT></B>
must be included before including this file.
<P><LI>
<B><TT>X11/Xutil.h</TT></B>

<P>

This file declares various functions, types, and symbols used for
inter-client communication and application utility functions,
which are described in
"<A HREF="../ICC/">Inter-Client Communication Functions</A>"
and "<A HREF="../utilities/">Application Utility Functions</A>".
<B><TT>X11/Xlib.h</TT></B>
must be included before including this file.
<P><LI>
<B><TT>X11/Xresource.h</TT></B>

<P>

This file declares all functions, types, and symbols for the
resource manager facilities, which are described in 
"<A HREF="../resource-manager/">Resource Manager Functions</A>".
<B><TT>X11/Xlib.h</TT></B>
must be included before including this file.
<P><LI>
<B><TT>X11/Xatom.h</TT></B>

<P>

This file declares all predefined atoms, 
which are symbols with the prefix ``XA_''.
<P><LI>
<B><TT>X11/cursorfont.h</TT></B>

<P>

This file declares the cursor symbols for the standard cursor font,
which are listed in <A HREF="../appendix/b/">X Font Cursors</A>.
All cursor symbols have the prefix ``XC_''.
<P><LI>
<B><TT>X11/keysymdef.h</TT></B>

<P>

This file declares all standard KeySym values,
which are symbols with the prefix ``XK_''.
The KeySyms are arranged in groups, and a preprocessor symbol controls
inclusion of each group.  The preprocessor symbol must be defined
prior to inclusion of the file to obtain the associated values.
The preprocessor symbols are XK_MISCELLANY, XK_LATIN1, XK_LATIN2,
XK_LATIN3, XK_LATIN4, XK_KATAKANA, XK_ARABIC, XK_CYRILLIC, XK_GREEK,
XK_TECHNICAL, XK_SPECIAL, XK_PUBLISHING, XK_APL, XK_HEBREW,
XK_THAI, and XK_KOREAN.
<P><LI>
<B><TT>X11/keysym.h</TT></B>

<P>

This file defines the preprocessor symbols
XK_MISCELLANY, XK_LATIN1, XK_LATIN2, XK_LATIN3, XK_LATIN4, and XK_GREEK
and then includes
<B><TT>X11/keysymdef.h</TT></B>.
<P><LI>
<B><TT>X11/Xlibint.h</TT></B>

<P>

This file declares all the functions, types, and symbols used for
extensions, which are described in <A HREF="../appendix/c/">Extensions</A>.
This file automatically includes
<B><TT>X11/Xlib.h</TT></B>.
<P><LI>
<B><TT>X11/Xproto.h</TT></B>

<P>

This file declares types and symbols for the basic X protocol,
for use in implementing extensions.
It is included automatically from
<B><TT>X11/Xlibint.h</TT></B>,
so application and extension code should never need to
reference this file directly.
<P><LI>
<B><TT>X11/Xprotostr.h</TT></B>

<P>

This file declares types and symbols for the basic X protocol,
for use in implementing extensions.
It is included automatically from
<B><TT>X11/Xproto.h</TT></B>,
so application and extension code should never need to
reference this file directly.
<P><LI>
<B><TT>X11/X10.h</TT></B>

</UL>

This file declares all the functions, types, and symbols used for the
X10 compatibility functions, which are described in <A HREF="../appendix/d/">Compatibility Functions</A>.
