<H1 ALIGN=center>Chapter 1: Introduction to Xlib</H1>

The X Window System is a network-transparent window system
that was designed at <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</A>.
X display servers run on computers with either monochrome or color
bitmap display hardware.
The server distributes user input to and accepts output requests from various
client programs located either on the same machine or elsewhere in
the network.
Xlib is a C subroutine library that application programs (clients)
use to interface with the window system by means of a stream connection.
Although a client usually runs on the same machine as the X server 
it is talking to, this need not be the case.

<P>

<I>Xlib --- C Language X Interface</I> is a reference guide to the low-level 
C language interface to the X Window System protocol.
It is neither a <A HREF="/gui/x/xlib-tutorial/">tutorial</A> nor a user's guide to programming the X Window System.
Rather, it provides a detailed description of each function in the library
as well as a discussion of the related background information.
<I>Xlib --- C Language X Interface</I> assumes a basic understanding of a graphics 
window system and of the C programming language.
Other higher-level abstractions
(for example, those provided by the toolkits for X)
are built on top of the Xlib library.
For further information about these higher-level libraries,
see the appropriate toolkit documentation.
The <I>X Window System Protocol</I> provides the definitive word on the
behavior of X.
Although additional information appears here,
the protocol document is the ruling document.
