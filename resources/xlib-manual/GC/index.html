<H1 ALIGN=center>Chapter 7: Graphics Context Functions</H1>

A number of resources are used when performing graphics operations in X.
Most information about performing graphics (for example, foreground
color, background color, line style, and so on) is stored in
resources called graphics contexts (GC).
<!.IN "Graphics context">
Most graphics operations (see "<A HREF="../graphics/">Graphics Functions</A>") take a 
GC as an argument.
Although in theory the X protocol permits sharing of GCs between applications, 
it is expected that applications will use their own
GCs when performing operations. 
Sharing of GCs is highly discouraged because the library may cache GC state.

<P>

Graphics operations can be performed to either windows or pixmaps, 
which collectively are called drawables.
<!.IN "Root">
Each drawable exists on a single screen.
A GC is created for a specific screen and drawable depth
and can only be used with drawables of matching
screen and depth.
