<H1 ALIGN=center>2.6. X Server Connection Close Operations</H1>

When the X server's connection to a client is closed
either by an explicit call to
<B><A HREF="XCloseDisplay.html">XCloseDisplay()</A></B>
or by a process that exits, the X server performs the following
automatic operations:

<UL>
<P><LI>
It disowns all selections owned by the client
(see 
<B><A HREF="../window-information/XSetSelectionOwner.html">XSetSelectionOwner()</A></B>).

<P><LI>
It performs an
<B><A HREF="../input/XUngrabPointer.html">XUngrabPointer()</A></B>
and
<B><A HREF="../input/XUngrabKeyboard.html">XUngrabKeyboard()</A></B>
if the client has actively grabbed the pointer 
or the keyboard.

<P><LI>
It performs an
<B><A HREF="../window-and-session-manager/XUngrabServer.html">XUngrabServer()</A></B>
if the client has grabbed the server.

<P><LI>
It releases all <A HREF="passive-grabs">passive grabs</a> made by the client.  

<P><LI>
It marks all resources (including colormap entries) allocated 
by the client either as permanent or temporary, 
depending on whether the close-down mode is 
<B>RetainPermanent</B>
or
<B>RetainTemporary</B>.
However, this does not prevent other client applications from explicitly
destroying the resources (see 
<B><A HREF="XSetCloseDownMode.html">XSetCloseDownMode()</A></B>).
</UL>

<P>

When the close-down mode is
<B>DestroyAll</B>,
the X server destroys all of a client's resources as follows:

<UL>
<P><LI>
It examines each window in the client's save-set to determine if it is an inferior
(subwindow) of a window created by the client.
(The save-set is a list of other clients' windows, 
which are referred to as save-set windows.)
If so, the X server reparents the save-set window to the closest ancestor so
that the save-set window is not an inferior of a window created by the client.
The reparenting leaves unchanged the absolute coordinates (with respect to
the root window) of the upper-left outer corner of the save-set
window.

<P><LI>
It performs a
<B>MapWindow</B>
request on the save-set window if the save-set window is unmapped.
The X server does this even if the save-set window was not an inferior of 
a window created by the client.

<P><LI>
It destroys all windows created by the client.

<P><LI>
It performs the appropriate free request on each nonwindow resource created by
the client in the server (for example, 
<A HREF="../graphics/font-metrics/">Font</A>, 
<A HREF="../pixmap-and-cursor/pixmap.html">Pixmap</A>, 
<A HREF="../pixmap-and-cursor/cursor.html">Cursor</A>, 
<A HREF="../color/#colormap">Colormap</A>, 
and 
<B><A HREF="../my-own/gcontext.html">GContext</A></B>).

<P><LI>
It frees all colors and colormap entries allocated by a client application.
</UL>

<P>

Additional processing occurs when the last connection to the X server closes.
An X server goes through a cycle of having no connections and having some
connections.
When the last connection to the X server closes as a result of a connection
closing with the close_mode of
<B>DestroyAll</B>,
the X server does the following: 

<UL>
<P><LI>
It resets its state as if it had just been
started.  
The X server begins by destroying all lingering resources from
clients that have terminated in 
<B>RetainPermanent</B>
or
<B>RetainTemporary</B>
mode.

<P><LI>
It deletes all but the predefined atom identifiers.

<P><LI>
It deletes all properties on all root windows (see section "<A HREF="../window-information/properties-and-atoms.html">Properties and Atoms</A>").

<P><LI>
It resets all device maps and attributes 
(for example, key click, bell volume, and acceleration) 
as well as the access control list.

<P><LI>
It restores the standard root tiles and cursors.

<P><LI>
It restores the default font path.

<P><LI>
It restores the input focus to state
<B>PointerRoot</B>.
</UL>
<P>

However, the X server does not reset if you close a connection with a close-down
mode set to
<B>RetainPermanent</B>
or
<B>RetainTemporary</B>.
