<!.IN "Events" "ColormapNotify">
<!.IN "ColormapNotify" "" "@DEF@">

The X server can report
<B>ColormapNotify</B>
events to clients wanting information about when the colormap changes 
and when a colormap is installed or uninstalled. 
The X server generates this event type whenever a client application:

<UL>


<P><LI>
Changes the colormap member of the
<A HREF="../window/attributes/#XSetWindowAttributes">XSetWindowAttributes</A>
structure by 
calling
<B><A HREF="../window/XChangeWindowAttributes.html">XChangeWindowAttributes()</A></B>,
<B><A HREF="../color/XFreeColormap.html">XFreeColormap()</A></B>,
or
<B><A HREF="../window/XSetWindowColormap.html">XSetWindowColormap()</A></B>

<P><LI>
Installs or uninstalls the colormap by calling
<B><A HREF="../window-and-session-manager/XInstallColormap.html">XInstallColormap()</A></B>
or
<B><A HREF="../window-and-session-manager/XUninstallColormap.html">XUninstallColormap()</A></B>

</UL>

<P>

To receive 
<B>ColormapNotify</B>
events, set the
<B>ColormapChangeMask</B>
bit in the <A HREF="../window/attributes/event-and-do-not-propagate.html">event-mask</A> attribute of the window. 

<A NAME="XColormapEvent"></A>
<P>

The structure for this event type contains:

<P>

<!.IN "XColormapEvent" "" "@DEF@">

<PRE><CODE>

typedef struct {
	int type;	/* ColormapNotify */
	unsigned long serial;	/* # of last request processed by server */
	Bool send_event;	/* true if this came from a <B><A HREF="../appendix/a.html#SendEvent">SendEvent</A></B> request */
	Display *display;	/* Display the event was read from */
	Window window;
	Colormap colormap;	/* colormap or None */
	Bool new;
	int state;	/* ColormapInstalled, ColormapUninstalled */
} XColormapEvent;

</PRE></CODE>

<P>

The <B>window</B> member is set to the window whose associated 
colormap is changed, installed, or uninstalled.
For a colormap that is changed, installed, or uninstalled,
the <B>colormap</B> member is set to the colormap associated with the window. 
For a colormap that is changed by a call to
<B><A HREF="../color/XFreeColormap.html">XFreeColormap()</A></B>,
the <B>colormap</B> member is set to
<B>None</B>.
The new member is set to indicate whether the colormap 
for the specified window was changed or installed or uninstalled
and can be 
<B>True</B>
or
<B>False</B>.
If it is
<B>True</B>,
the colormap was changed.
If it is
<B>False</B>,
the colormap was installed or uninstalled.
The <B>state</B> member is always set to indicate whether the colormap is installed or
uninstalled and can be 
<B>ColormapInstalled</B>
or
<B>ColormapUninstalled</B>.
