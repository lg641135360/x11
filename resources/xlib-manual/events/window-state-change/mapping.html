<!.IN "Events" "MappingNotify">
<!.IN "MappingNotify" "" "@DEF@">
The X server reports
<B>MappingNotify</B>
events to all clients.
There is no mechanism to express disinterest in this event.
The X server generates this event type whenever a client application 
successfully calls:

<UL>

<P><LI>
<B><A HREF="../../input/XSetModifierMapping.html">XSetModifierMapping()</A></B>
to indicate which KeyCodes are to be used as modifiers

<P><LI>
<B><A HREF="../../input/XChangeKeyboardMapping.html">XChangeKeyboardMapping()</A></B>
to change the keyboard mapping

<P><LI>
<B><A HREF="../../input/XSetPointerMapping.html">XSetPointerMapping()</A></B>
to set the pointer mapping

</UL>

<A NAME="XMappingEvent"></A>
<P>

The structure for this event type contains:

<P>

<!.IN "XMappingEvent" "" "@DEF@">

<PRE><CODE>
typedef struct {
	int type;		/* MappingNotify */
	unsigned long serial;	/* # of last request processed by server */
	Bool send_event;	/* true if this came from a <B><A HREF="../../appendix/a.html#SendEvent">SendEvent</A></B> request */
	Display *display;	/* Display the event was read from */
	Window window;		/* unused */
	int request;		/* one of MappingModifier, MappingKeyboard, MappingPointer */
	int first_keycode;	/* first keycode */
	int count;		/* defines range of change w. first_keycode*/
} XMappingEvent;

</PRE></CODE>

<P>

The <B>request</B> member is set to indicate the kind of mapping change that occurred
and can be
<B>MappingModifier</B>,
<B>MappingKeyboard</B>,
<B>MappingPointer</B>.
If it is
<B>MappingModifier</B>,
the modifier mapping was changed.
If it is
<B>MappingKeyboard</B>,
the keyboard mapping was changed.
If it is
<B>MappingPointer</B>,
the pointer button mapping was changed. 
The <B>first_keycode</B> and <B>count</B> members are set only 
if the <B>request</B> member was set to
<B>MappingKeyboard</B> .
The number in <B>first_keycode</B> represents the first number in the range 
of the altered mapping, 
and <B>count</B> represents the number of keycodes altered.

<P>

To update the client application's knowledge of the keyboard,
you should call
<B><A HREF="../../utilities/keyboard/XRefreshKeyboardMapping.html">XRefreshKeyboardMapping()</A></B>.
