The X server can report
<B>ConfigureNotify</B>
events to clients wanting information about actual changes to a window's
state, such as size, position, border, and stacking order.
The X server generates this event type whenever one of the following configure 
window requests made by a client application actually completes:

<UL>

<LI> A window's size, position, border, and/or stacking order is reconfigured 
by calling
<B><A HREF="../../window/XConfigureWindow.html">XConfigureWindow()</A></B>.

<LI>
The window's position in the stacking order is changed by calling
<B><A HREF="../../window/XLowerWindow.html">XLowerWindow()</A></B>,
<B><A HREF="../../window/XRaiseWindow.html">XRaiseWindow()</A></B>,
or
<B><A HREF="../../window/XRestackWindows.html">XRestackWindows()</A></B>.

<LI>
A window is moved by calling
<B><A HREF="../../window/XMoveWindow.html">XMoveWindow()</A></B>.

<LI>
A window's size is changed by calling
<B><A HREF="../../window/XResizeWindow.html">XResizeWindow()</A></B>.

<LI>
A window's size and location is changed by calling
<B><A HREF="../../window/XMoveResizeWindow.html">XMoveResizeWindow()</A></B>.

<LI>
A window is mapped and its position in the stacking order is changed
by calling
<B><A HREF="../../window/XMapRaised.html">XMapRaised()</A></B>.

<LI>
A window's border width is changed by calling
<B><A HREF="../../window/XSetWindowBorderWidth.html">XSetWindowBorderWidth()</A></B>.

</UL>

<P>

To receive 
<B>ConfigureNotify</B>
events, set the
<B>StructureNotifyMask</B>
bit in the event-mask attribute of the window or the
<B>SubstructureNotifyMask</B>
bit in the <A HREF="../../window/attributes/event-and-do-not-propagate.html">event-mask</A> attribute of the parent window
(in which case, configuring any child generates an event).

<A NAME="XConfigureEvent"></A>
<P>

The structure for this event type contains:

<P>

<PRE><CODE>
typedef struct {
	int <B>type</B>;	        /* ConfigureNotify */
	unsigned long <B>serial</B>;	/* # of last request processed by server */
	Bool <B>send_event</B>;	/* true if this came from a <B><A HREF="../../appendix/a.html#SendEvent">SendEvent</A></B> request */
	Display *<B>display</B>;	/* Display the event was read from */
	Window <B>event</B>;
	Window <B>window</B>;
	int <B>x</B>, <B>y</B>;
	int <B>width</B>, <B>height</B>;
	int <B>border_width</B>;
	Window <B>above</B>;
	Bool <B>override_redirect</B>;
} XConfigureEvent;
</CODE></PRE>

<P>

The <B>event</B> member is set either to the reconfigured window or to its parent,
depending on whether
<B>StructureNotify</B>
or
<B>SubstructureNotify</B>
was selected.
The <B>window</B> member is set to the window whose size, position, 
border, and/or stacking
order was changed.

<P>

The <B>x</B> and <B>y</B> members are set to the coordinates relative to the parent window's 
origin and indicate the position of the upper-left outside corner of the window.
The <B>width</B> and <B>height</B> members are set to the inside size of the window, 
not including
the border.
The <B>border_width</B> member is set to the width of the window's border, in pixels.

<P>

The <B>above</B> member is set to the sibling window and is used 
for stacking operations.
If the X server sets this member to
<B>None</B> ,
the window whose state was changed is on the bottom of the stack
with respect to sibling windows.
However, if this member is set to a sibling window, 
the window whose state was changed is placed on top of this sibling window.

<P>

The <B>override_redirect</B> member is set to the <A HREF="../../window/attributes/override-redirect.html">override-redirect</A> attribute of the
window.
Window manager clients normally should ignore this window if the 
override_redirect member
is
<B>True</B>.
