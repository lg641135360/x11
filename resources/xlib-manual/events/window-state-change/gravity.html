<H1 ALIGN=center>10.10.5 GravityNotify Events</H1>

The X server can report
<B>GravityNotify</B>
events to clients wanting information about when a window is moved because of a
change in the size of its parent.
The X server generates this event whenever a client
application actually moves a child window as a result of resizing its parent by calling
<B><A HREF="../../window/XConfigureWindow.html">XConfigureWindow()</A></B>,
<B><A HREF="../../window/XMoveResizeWindow.html">XMoveResizeWindow()</A></B>,
or
<B><A HREF="../../window/XResizeWindow.html">XResizeWindow()</A></B>. 

<P>

To receive 
<B>GravityNotify</B>
events, set the
<B>StructureNotifyMask</B>
bit in the <A HREF="../../window/attributes/event-and-do-not-propagate.html">event-mask</A> attribute of the window or the
<B>SubstructureNotifyMask</B>
bit in the <A HREF="../../window/attributes/event-and-do-not-propagate.html">event-mask</A> attribute of the parent window
(in which case, any child that is moved because its parent has been resized
generates an event).

<A NAME="XGravityEvent"></A>
<P>

The structure for this event type contains:

<P>

<PRE><CODE>
typedef struct {
	int type;	        /* GravityNotify */
	unsigned long serial;	/* # of last request processed by server */
	Bool send_event;	/* true if this came from a <B><A HREF="../../appendix/a.html#SendEvent">SendEvent</A></B> request */
	Display *display;	/* Display the event was read from */
	Window event;
	Window window;
	int x, y;
} XGravityEvent;
</CODE></PRE>

<P>

The <B>event</B> member is set either to the window that was moved or to its parent,
depending on whether
<B>StructureNotify</B>
or
<B>SubstructureNotify</B>
was selected.
The <B>window</B> member is set to the child window that was moved.
The <B>x</B> and <B>y</B> members are set to the coordinates relative to the 
new parent window's origin
and indicate the position of the upper-left outside corner of the 
window.
