<!.IN "Events" "VisibilityNotify">
<!.IN "VisibilityNotify" "" "@DEF@">
The X server can report
<B>VisibilityNotify</B>
events to clients wanting any change in the visibility of the specified window.
A region of a window is visible if someone looking at the screen can
actually see it.
The X server generates this event whenever the visibility changes state. 
However, this event is never generated for windows whose class is
<B><A HREF="../../window/create.html#InputClass">InputOnly</A></B> .

<P>

All 
<B>VisibilityNotify</B>
events caused by a hierarchy change are generated
after any hierarchy event
(<B><A HREF="unmap.html">UnmapNotify</A></B>,
<B><A HREF="map.html">MapNotify</A></B>, 
<B><A HREF="configure.html">ConfigureNotify</A></B> ,
<B><A HREF="gravity.html">GravityNotify</A></B> ,
<B><A HREF="circulate.html">CirculateNotify</A></B>)
caused by that change. Any
<B>VisibilityNotify</B>
event on a given window is generated before any
<B><A HREF="../exposure/expose.html">Expose</A></B> 
events on that window, but it is not required that all
<B>VisibilityNotify</B>
events on all windows be generated before all 
<B><A HREF="../exposure/expose.html">Expose</A></B>
events on all windows.  
The X protocol does not constrain the ordering of 
<B>VisibilityNotify</B>
events with
respect to 
<B><A HREF="../input-focus/">FocusOut</A></B>,
<B><A HREF="../window-entry-exit/">EnterNotify</A></B>,
and 
<B><A HREF="../window-entry-exit/">LeaveNotify</A></B>
events.

<P>

To receive 
<B>VisibilityNotify</B>
events, set the
<B>VisibilityChangeMask</B>
bit in the <A HREF="../../window/attributes/event-and-do-not-propagate.html">event-mask</A> attribute of the window. 

<P>

The structure for this event type contains:

<P>

<!.IN "XVisibilityEvent" "" "@DEF@">
<CODE><PRE>
typedef struct {
	int type;		/* VisibiltyNotify */
	unsigned long serial;	/* # of last request processed by server */
	Bool send_event;	/* true if this came from a <B><A HREF="../../appendix/a.html#SendEvent">SendEvent</A></B> request */
	Display *display;	/* Display the event was read from */
	Window window;
	int state;
} XVisibilityEvent;
</PRE></CODE>

<P>

The window member is set to the window whose visibility state changes.
The state member is set to the state of the window's visibility and can be
<B>VisibilityUnobscured</B>,
<B>VisibilityPartiallyObscured</B>,
or
<B>VisibilityFullyObscured</B>.
The X server ignores all of a window's subwindows
when determining the visibility state of the window and processes 
<B>VisibilityNotify</B>
events according to the following:

<UL>

<P><LI>
When the window changes state from partially obscured, fully obscured,
or not viewable to viewable and completely unobscured,
the X server generates the event with the state member of the
<B>XVisibilityEvent</B>
structure set to
<B>VisibilityUnobscured</B>.

<P><LI>
When the window changes state from viewable and completely unobscured or 
not viewable to viewable and partially obscured,
the X server generates the event with the state member of the
<B>XVisibilityEvent</B>
structure set to
<B>VisibilityPartiallyObscured</B>.

<P><LI>
When the window changes state from viewable and completely unobscured, 
viewable and partially obscured, or not viewable to viewable and 
fully obscured,
the X server generates the event with the state member of the
<B>XVisibilityEvent</B>
structure set to
<B>VisibilityFullyObscured</B>.
