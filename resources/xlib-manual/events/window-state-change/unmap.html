<!.IN "Events" "UnmapNotify">
<!.IN "UnmapNotify" "" "@DEF@">
The X server can report
<B>UnmapNotify</B>
events to clients wanting information about which windows are unmapped.
The X server generates this event type whenever a client application changes the
window's state from mapped to unmapped.

<P>

To receive 
<B>UnmapNotify</B>
events, set the
<B>StructureNotifyMask</B>
bit in the <A HREF="../../window/attributes/event-and-do-not-propagate.html">event-mask</A> attribute of the window or the
<B>SubstructureNotifyMask</B>
bit in the <A HREF="../../window/attributes/event-and-do-not-propagate.html">event-mask</A> attribute of the parent window
(in which case, unmapping any child window generates an event).

<A NAME="XUnmapEvent"></A>
<P>

The structure for this event type contains:

<P>

<!.IN "XUnmapEvent" "" "@DEF@">

<PRE><CODE>

typedef struct {
	int type;	/* UnmapNotify */
	unsigned long serial;	/* # of last request processed by server */
	Bool send_event;	/* true if this came from a <B><A HREF="../../appendix/a.html#SendEvent">SendEvent</A></B> request */
	Display *display;	/* Display the event was read from */
	Window event;
	Window window;
	Bool from_configure;
} XUnmapEvent;
</CODE></PRE>

<P>

The <B>event</B> member is set either to the unmapped window or to its parent,
depending on whether
<B>StructureNotify</B>
or
<B>SubstructureNotify</B>
was selected.
This is the window used by the X server to report the event.
The <B>window</B> member is set to the window that was unmapped.
The <B>from_configure</B> member is set to
<B>True</B> 
if the event was generated as a result of a resizing of the window's parent when
the window itself had a win_gravity of
<B>UnmapGravity</B>.
