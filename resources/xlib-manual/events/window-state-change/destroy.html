<!.IN "Events" "DestroyNotify">
<!.IN "DestroyNotify" "" "@DEF@">
The X server can report
<B>DestroyNotify</B>
events to clients wanting information about which windows are destroyed.
The X server generates this event whenever a client application destroys a 
window by calling
<B><A HREF="../../window/XDestroyWindow.html">XDestroyWindow()</A></B>
or
<B><A HREF="../../window/XDestroySubWindows.html">XDestroySubwindows()</A></B>.

<P>

The ordering of the 
<B>DestroyNotify</B> 
events is such that for any given window, 
<B>DestroyNotify</B>
is generated on all inferiors of the window
before being generated on the window itself.  
The X protocol does not constrain the ordering among
siblings and across subhierarchies.

<P>

To receive 
<B>DestroyNotify</B>
events, set the
<B>StructureNotifyMask</B>
bit in the <A HREF="../../window/attributes/event-and-do-not-propagate.html">event-mask</A> attribute of the window or the
<B>SubstructureNotifyMask</B>
bit in the <A HREF="../../window/attributes/event-and-do-not-propagate.html">event-mask</A> attribute of the parent window
(in which case, destroying any child generates an event).

<A NAME="XDestroyWindowEvent"></A>
<P>

The structure for this event type contains:

<P>

<!.IN "XDestroyWindowEvent" "" "@DEF@">

<PRE><CODE>

typedef struct {
	int type;		/* DestroyNotify */
	unsigned long serial;	/* # of last request processed by server */
	Bool send_event;	/* true if this came from a <B><A HREF="../../appendix/a.html#SendEvent">SendEvent</A></B> request */
	Display *display;	/* Display the event was read from */
	Window event;
	Window window;
} XDestroyWindowEvent;

</CODE></PRE>

<P>

The <B>event</B> member is set either to the destroyed window or to its parent,
depending on whether
<B>StructureNotify</B>
or 
<B>SubstructureNotify</B>
was selected.
The <B>window</B> member is set to the window that is destroyed.
