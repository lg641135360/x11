<H1 ALIGN=center>10.8 Key Map State Notification Events</H1>

<A NAME="KeymapNotify"></A>

<!.IN "Events" "KeymapNotify">
<!.IN "KeymapNotify" "" "@DEF@">
The X server can report
<B>KeymapNotify</B>
events to clients that want information about changes in their keyboard state.

<P>

To receive
<B>KeymapNotify</B>
events, set the
<B>KeymapStateMask</B>
bit in the <A HREF="../window/attributes/event-and-do-not-propagate.html">event-mask</A> attribute of the window. 
The X server generates this event immediately after every
<B><A HREF="window-entry-exit/">EnterNotify</A></B>
and
<B><A HREF="input-focus/">FocusIn</A></B>
event.

<P>

The structure for this event type contains:

<A NAME="XKeymapEvent"></A>
<P>

<!.IN "XKeymapEvent" "" "@DEF@">

<CODE><PRE>

/* generated on EnterWindow and FocusIn when KeymapState selected */
typedef struct {
	int type;		/* KeymapNotify */
	unsigned long serial;	/* # of last request processed by server */
	Bool send_event;	/* true if this came from a <B><A HREF="../appendix/a.html#SendEvent">SendEvent</A></B> request */
	Display *display;	/* Display the event was read from */
	Window window;
	char key_vector[32];
} XKeymapEvent;	
</PRE></CODE>

<P>

The <B>window</B> member is not used but is present to aid some toolkits.
The <B>key_vector</B> member is set to the bit vector of the keyboard.
Each bit set to 1 indicates that the corresponding key 
is currently pressed.
The vector is represented as 32 bytes.
Byte N (from 0) contains the bits for keys 8N to 8N + 7 
with the least-significant bit in the byte representing key 8N.
