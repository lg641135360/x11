<H1 ALIGN=center>10.9.2 GraphicsExpose and NoExpose Events</H1>

<!.IN "Events" "GraphicsExpose">
<!.IN "Events" "NoExpose">
<!.IN "GraphicsExpose" "" "@DEF@">

The X server can report
<B>GraphicsExpose</B>
events to clients wanting information about when a destination region could not
be computed during certain graphics requests:
<B><A HREF="../../graphics/XCopyArea.html">XCopyArea()</A></B>
or
<B><A HREF="../../graphics/XCopyPlane.html">XCopyPlane()</A></B>.
The X server generates this event whenever a destination region could not be
computed due to an obscured or out-of-bounds source region.
In addition, the X server guarantees to report contiguously all of the regions exposed by
some graphics request 
(for example, copying an area of a drawable to a destination
drawable).

<P>

<!.IN "NoExpose" "" "@DEF@">
The X server generates a
<B>NoExpose</B>
event whenever a graphics request that might
produce a
<B>GraphicsExpose</B>
event does not produce any.
In other words, the client is really asking for a
<B>GraphicsExpose</B>
event but instead receives a
<B>NoExpose</B>
event.

<P>

To receive
<B>GraphicsExpose</B>
or
<B>NoExpose</B>
events, you must first set the graphics-exposure 
attribute of the graphics context to
<B>True</B>.
You also can set the graphics-expose attribute when creating a graphics
context using
<B><A HREF="../../GC/XCreateGC.html">XCreateGC()</A></B>
or by calling
<B><A HREF="../../GC/convenience-functions/XSetGraphicsExposures.html">XSetGraphicsExposures()</A></B>.

<P>

The structures for these event types contain:

<A NAME="XGraphicsExposeEvent"></A>
<P>

<!.IN "XGraphicsExposeEvent" "" "@DEF@">
<CODE><PRE>
typedef struct {
	int type;		/* GraphicsExpose */
	unsigned long serial;	/* # of last request processed by server */
	Bool send_event;	/* true if this came from a <B><A HREF="../../appendix/a.html#SendEvent">SendEvent</A></B> request */
	Display *display;	/* Display the event was read from */
	Drawable drawable;
	int x, y;
	int width, height;
	int count;		/* if nonzero, at least this many more */
	int major_code;		/* core is CopyArea or CopyPlane */
	int minor_code;		/* not defined in the core */
} XGraphicsExposeEvent;
</PRE></CODE>

<A NAME="XNoExposeEvent"></A>
<P>

<!.IN "XNoExposeEvent" "" "@DEF@">
<CODE><PRE>
typedef struct {
	int type;	/* NoExpose */
	unsigned long serial;	/* # of last request processed by server */
	Bool send_event;	/* true if this came from a <B><A HREF="../../appendix/a.html#SendEvent">SendEvent</A></B> request */
	Display *display;	/* Display the event was read from */
	Drawable drawable;
	int major_code;	/* core is CopyArea or CopyPlane */
	int minor_code;	/* not defined in the core */
} XNoExposeEvent;
</PRE></CODE>

<P>

Both structures have these common members: drawable, major_code, and minor_code.
The drawable member is set to the drawable of the destination region on 
which the graphics request was to be performed.
The major_code member is set to the graphics request initiated by the client
and can be either
<B>X_CopyArea</B>
or
<B>X_CopyPlane</B>.
If it is
<B>X_CopyArea</B>,
a call to
<B><A HREF="../../graphics/XCopyArea.html">XCopyArea()</A></B>
initiated the request.
If it is
<B>X_CopyPlane</B>,
a call to
<B><A HREF="../../graphics/XCopyPlane.html">XCopyPlane()</A></B>
initiated the request.
These constants are defined in 
<B><TT>&lt;X11/Xproto.h&gt;</TT></B>.
The minor_code member,
like the major_code member, 
indicates which graphics request was initiated by
the client. 
However, the minor_code member is not defined by the core
X protocol and will be zero in these cases, 
although it may be used by an extension.

<P>

The 
<B>XGraphicsExposeEvent</B>
structure has these additional members: x, y, width, height, and count. 
The x and y members are set to the coordinates relative to the drawable's origin
and indicate the upper-left corner of the rectangle.
The width and height members are set to the size (extent) of the rectangle.
The count member is set to the number of
<B>GraphicsExpose</B>
events to follow.
If count is zero, no more
<B>GraphicsExpose</B>
events follow for this window.
However, if count is nonzero, at least that number of
<B>GraphicsExpose</B>
events (and possibly more) are to follow for this window.
