<!.IN "Events" "Expose">
<!.IN "Expose" "" "@DEF@">

The X server can report
<B>Expose</B>
events to clients wanting information about when the contents of window regions
have been lost.
The circumstances in which the X server generates
<B>Expose</B>
events are not as definite as those for other events.
However, the X server never generates
<B>Expose</B>
events on windows whose class you specified as
<B><A HREF="../../window/create.html#InputClass">InputOnly</A></B> .
The X server can generate
<B>Expose</B>
events when no valid contents are available for regions of a window
and either the regions are visible, 
the regions are viewable and the server is (perhaps newly) maintaining 
backing store on the window,
or the window is not viewable but the server is (perhaps newly) honoring the
window's <A HREF="../../window/attributes/backing-store.html">backing-store</A> attribute of
<B>Always</B>
or
<B>WhenMapped</B>.
The regions decompose into an (arbitrary) set of rectangles,
and an
<B>Expose</B>
event is generated for each rectangle.
For any given window,
the X server guarantees to report contiguously 
all of the regions exposed by some action that causes 
<B>Expose</B>
events, such as raising a window.

<P>

To receive
<B>Expose</B>
events, set the
<B>ExposureMask</B>
bit in the <A HREF="../../window/attributes/event-and-do-not-propagate.html">event-mask</A> attribute of the window. 

<A NAME="XExposeEvent"></A>
<P>

The structure for this event type contains:

<P>

<!.IN "XExposeEvent" "" "@DEF@">
<CODE><PRE>
typedef struct {
	int type;		/* Expose */
	unsigned long serial;	/* # of last request processed by server */
	Bool send_event;	/* true if this came from a <B><A HREF="../../appendix/a.html#SendEvent">SendEvent</A></B> request */
	<A HREF="../../display/opening.html#Display">Display</A> *display;	/* Display the event was read from */
	Window window;
	int x, y;
	int width, height;
	int count;		/* if nonzero, at least this many more */
} XExposeEvent;
</PRE></CODE>

<P>

The <B>window</B> member is set to the exposed (damaged) window.

<P>

The <B>x</B> and <B>y</B> members are set to the coordinates relative to the window's origin
and indicate the upper-left corner of the rectangle.

<P>

The <B>width</B> and <B>height</B> members are set to the size (extent) of the rectangle.

<P>

The <B>count</B> member is set to the number of
<B>Expose</B>
events that are to follow.
If <B>count</B> is zero, no more
<B>Expose</B>
events follow for this window.
However, if <B>count</B> is nonzero, at least that number of 
<B>Expose</B>
events (and possibly more) follow for this window.
Simple applications that do not want to optimize redisplay by distinguishing
between subareas of its window can just ignore all
<B>Expose</B>
events with nonzero counts and perform full redisplays
on events with zero counts.
