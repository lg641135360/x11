Pseudo-motion mode
<B><A HREF="./">EnterNotify</A></B>
and
<B><A HREF="./">LeaveNotify</A></B>
events are generated when a pointer grab activates or deactivates.
Events in which the pointer grab activates
are identified by
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XEnterWindowEvent</A>
or
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XLeaveWindowEvent</A>
structures whose <B>mode</B> member is set to 
<B>NotifyGrab</B>.
Events in which the pointer grab deactivates
are identified by
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XEnterWindowEvent</A>
or
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XLeaveWindowEvent</A>
structures whose <B>mode</B> member is set to 
<B>NotifyUngrab</B>
(see
<B><A HREF="../../window-and-session-manager/XGrabPointer.html">XGrabPointer()</A></B>).

When a pointer grab activates after any initial warp into a confine_to
window and before generating any actual
<B><A HREF="../keyboard-pointer/keyboard-pointer.html">ButtonPress</A></B> 
event that activates the grab, 
G is the grab_window for the grab, 
and P is the window the pointer is in, 
the X server does the following:

<UL>

<P><LI>
It generates
<B><A HREF="./">EnterNotify</A></B>
and
<B><A HREF="./">LeaveNotify</A></B>
events (see "<A HREF="normal.html">Normal Entry/Exit Events</A>")
with the <B>mode</B> members of the 
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XEnterWindowEvent</A>
and
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XLeaveWindowEvent</A>
structures set to 
<B>NotifyGrab</B>.
These events are generated
as if the pointer were to suddenly warp from
its current position in P to some position in G.
However, the pointer does not warp, and the X server uses the pointer position 
as both the initial and final positions for the events.

When a pointer grab deactivates after generating any actual
<B><A HREF="../keyboard-pointer/keyboard-pointer.html">ButtonRelease</A></B>
event that deactivates the grab, 
G is the grab_window for the grab,

the X server does the following:

<P><LI>
It generates
<B><A HREF="./">EnterNotify</A></B>

events (see "<A HREF="normal.html">Normal Entry/Exit Events</A>")
with the <B>mode</B> members of the
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XEnterWindowEvent</A>
and
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XLeaveWindowEvent</A>
structures set to 
<B>NotifyUngrab</B>.
These events are generated as if the pointer were to suddenly warp from
some position in G to its current position in P.
However, the pointer does not warp, and the X server uses the
current pointer position as both the
initial and final positions for the events.
