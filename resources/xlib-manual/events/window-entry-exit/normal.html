<B><A HREF="./">EnterNotify</A></B>
and
<B><A HREF="./">LeaveNotify</A></B>
events are generated when the pointer moves from
one window to another window.
Normal events are identified by
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XEnterWindowEvent</A>
or
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XLeaveWindowEvent</A>
structures whose mode member is set to
<B>NotifyNormal</B>.

When the pointer moves from window A to window B and A is an inferior of B, 
the X server does the following:

<UL>

<P><LI>
It generates a
<B><A HREF="./">LeaveNotify</A></B>
event on window A, with the <B>detail</B> member of the
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XLeaveWindowEvent</A>
structure set to
<B>NotifyAncestor</B>.

<P><LI>
It generates a
<B><A HREF="./">LeaveNotify</A></B>
event on each window between window A and window B, exclusive,
with the <B>detail</B> member of each
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XLeaveWindowEvent</A>
structure set to
<B>NotifyVirtual</B>.

<P><LI>
It generates an
<B><A HREF="./">EnterNotify</A></B>
event on window B, with the <B>detail</B> member of the 
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XEnterWindowEvent</A>
structure set to
<B>NotifyInferior</B>.

</UL>

<P><LI>
When the pointer moves from window A to window B and B is an inferior of A,
the X server does the following:

<UL>

<P><LI>
It generates a
<B><A HREF="./">LeaveNotify</A></B>
event on window A,
with the <B>detail</B> member of the
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XLeaveWindowEvent</A>
structure set to
<B>NotifyInferior</B>.

<P><LI>
It generates an
<B><A HREF="./">EnterNotify</A></B>
event on each window between window A and window B, exclusive, with the 
<B>detail</B> member of each 
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XEnterWindowEvent</A>
structure set to
<B>NotifyVirtual</B>. 

<P><LI>
It generates an
<B><A HREF="./">EnterNotify</A></B>
event on window B, with the <B>detail</B> member of the 
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XEnterWindowEvent</A>
structure set to
<B>NotifyAncestor</B>.

</UL>

<P><LI>
When the pointer moves from window A to window B 
and window C is their least common ancestor, 
the X server does the following:

<UL>

<P><LI>
It generates a
<B><A HREF="./">LeaveNotify</A></B>
event on window A,
with the <B>detail</B> member of the
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XLeaveWindowEvent</A>
structure set to 
<B>NotifyNonlinear</B>.

<P><LI>
It generates a
<B><A HREF="./">LeaveNotify</A></B>
event on each window between window A and window C, exclusive,
with the <B>detail</B> member of each
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XLeaveWindowEvent</A>
structure set to
<B>NotifyNonlinearVirtual</B>.

<P><LI>
It generates an
<B><A HREF="./">EnterNotify</A></B>
event on each window between window C and window B, exclusive, 
with the <B>detail</B> member of each
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XEnterWindowEvent</A>
structure set to
<B>NotifyNonlinearVirtual</B>.

<P><LI>
It generates an
<B><A HREF="./">EnterNotify</A></B>
event on window B, with the <B>detail</B> member of the 
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XEnterWindowEvent</A>
structure set to 
<B>NotifyNonlinear</B>.

</UL>

<P><LI>
When the pointer moves from window A to window B on different screens, 
the X server does the following:

<UL>

<P><LI>
It generates a
<B><A HREF="./">LeaveNotify</A></B>
event on window A,
with the <B>detail</B> member of the
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XLeaveWindowEvent</A>
structure set to 
<B>NotifyNonlinear</B>.

<P><LI>
If window A is not a root window,
it generates a
<B><A HREF="./">LeaveNotify</A></B>
event on each window above window A up to and including its root,
with the <B>detail</B> member of each
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XLeaveWindowEvent</A>
structure set to 
<B>NotifyNonlinearVirtual</B>.

<P><LI>
If window B is not a root window,
it generates an
<B><A HREF="./">EnterNotify</A></B>
event on each window from window B's root down to but not including
window B, with the <B>detail</B> member of each
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XEnterWindowEvent</A>
structure set to 
<B>NotifyNonlinearVirtual</B>.

<P><LI>
It generates an
<B><A HREF="./">EnterNotify</A></B>
event on window B, with the <B>detail</B> member of the
<A HREF="./#XCrossingEvent">XEnterWindowEvent</A>
structure set to 
<B>NotifyNonlinear</B>.
