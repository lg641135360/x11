<H1 ALIGN=center>10.6 Window Entry/Exit Events</H1>

<!.IN "Events" "EnterNotify">
<!.IN "Events" "LeaveNotify">
This section describes the processing that 
occurs for the window crossing events
<B>EnterNotify</B>
and
<B>LeaveNotify</B>.
<!.IN "EnterNotify" "" "@DEF@">
<!.IN "LeaveNotify" "" "@DEF@">
If a pointer motion or a window hierarchy change causes the
pointer to be in a different window than before, the X server reports
<B>EnterNotify</B>
or
<B>LeaveNotify</B>
events to clients who have selected for these events.
All 
<B>EnterNotify</B>
and 
<B>LeaveNotify</B>
events caused by a hierarchy change are
generated after any hierarchy event
(<B><A HREF="../window-state-change/unmap.html">UnmapNotify</A></B>,
<B><A HREF="../window-state-change/map.html">MapNotify</A></B>,
<B><A HREF="../window-state-change/configure.html">ConfigureNotify</A></B>,
<B><A HREF="../window-state-change/gravity.html">GravityNotify</A></B>,
<B><A HREF="../window-state-change/circulate.html">CirculateNotify</A></B>)
caused by that change;
however, the X protocol does not constrain the ordering of 
<B>EnterNotify</B>
and 
<B>LeaveNotify</B>
events with respect to
<B><A HREF="../input-focus/">FocusOut</A></B>, 
<B><A HREF="../window-state-change/visibility.html">VisibilityNotify</A></B>,
and 
<B><A HREF="../exposure/expose.html">Expose</A></B> 
events.

<P>

This contrasts with
<B><A HREF="../keyboard-pointer/keyboard-pointer.html">MotionNotify</A></B>
events, which are also generated when the pointer moves
but only when the pointer motion begins and ends in a single window.
An
<B>EnterNotify</B>
or
<B>LeaveNotify</B>
event also can be generated when some client application calls
<B><A HREF="../../input/XGrabPointer.html">XGrabPointer()</A></B>
and
<B><A HREF="/toto/XUngrabPointer.html">XUngrabPointer()</A></B>.

<P>

To receive
<B>EnterNotify</B>
or
<B>LeaveNotify</B>
events, set the
<B>EnterWindowMask</B>
or
<B>LeaveWindowMask</B>
bits of the <A HREF="../../window/attributes/event-and-do-not-propagate.html">event-mask</A> attribute of the window.

<P>

The structure for these event types contains:

<P>

<A NAME="XCrossingEvent"></A>
<A NAME="XEnterWindowEvent"></A>
<A NAME="XLeaveWindowEvent"></A>

<P>

The <B>window</B> member is set to the window on which the
<B>EnterNotify</B>
or
<B>LeaveNotify</B>
event was generated and is referred to as the event window. 
This is the window used by the X server to report the event, 
and is relative to the root
window on which the event occurred. 
The <B>root</B> member is set to the root window of the screen
on which the event occurred.

<P>

For a
<B>LeaveNotify</B>
event,
if a child of the event window contains the initial position of the pointer,
the <B>subwindow</B> component is set to that child.
Otherwise, the X server sets the <B>subwindow</B> member to
<B>None</B>.
For an
<B>EnterNotify</B>
event, if a child of the event window contains the final pointer position, 
the <B>subwindow</B> component is set to that child or
<B>None</B>.

<P>

The <B>time</B> member is set to the time when the event was generated
and is expressed in milliseconds.
The <B>x</B> and <B>y</B> members are set to the coordinates of the pointer position in 
the event window.
This position is always the pointer's final position,
not its initial position.
If the event window is on the same
screen as the root window, <B>x</B> and <B>y</B> are the pointer coordinates
relative to the event window's origin. 
Otherwise, <B>x</B> and <B>y</B> are set to zero.
The <B>x_root</B> and <B>y_root</B> members are set to the pointer's coordinates relative to the
root window's origin at the time of the event.

<P>

The <B>same_screen</B> member is set to indicate whether the event window is on the same screen
as the root window and can be either
<B>True</B> 
or
<B>False</B>.
If
<B>True</B>,
the event and root windows are on the same screen.
If
<B>False</B>,
the event and root windows are not on the same screen.

<P>

The <B>focus</B> member is set to indicate whether the event window is the focus window or an
inferior of the focus window.
The X server can set this member to either
<B>True</B> 
or
<B>False</B>.
If
<B>True</B>,
the event window is the focus window or an inferior of the focus window.
If
<B>False</B>,
the event window is not the focus window or an inferior of the focus window.

<P>

The <B>state</B> member is set to indicate the state of the pointer buttons and
modifier keys just prior to the
event.
The X server can set this member to the bitwise inclusive OR of one 
or more of the button or modifier key masks:
<B>Button1Mask</B>,
<B>Button2Mask</B>,
<B>Button3Mask</B>,
<B>Button4Mask</B>,
<B>Button5Mask</B>,
<B>ShiftMask</B>,
<B>LockMask</B>,
<B>ControlMask</B>,
<B>Mod1Mask</B>,
<B>Mod2Mask</B>,
<B>Mod3Mask</B>,
<B>Mod4Mask</B>,
<B>Mod5Mask</B>.

<P>

The <B>mode</B> member is set to indicate whether the events are normal events, 
<A HREF="grab-ungrab.html">pseudo-motion</A> events
when a grab activates, or <A HREF="grab-ungrab.html">pseudo-motion</A> events when a grab deactivates.
The X server can set this member to 
<B>NotifyNormal</B>,
<B>NotifyGrab</B>,
or
<B>NotifyUngrab</B>.

<P>

The <B>detail</B> member is set to indicate the notify detail and can be
<B>NotifyAncestor</B>,
<B>NotifyVirtual</B>,
<B>NotifyInferior</B>,
<B>NotifyNonlinear</B>,
or
<B>NotifyNonlinearVirtual</B>.
