<!.IN "Events" "SelectionClear" >

The X server reports
<B>SelectionClear</B>
events to the client losing ownership of a selection.
The X server generates this event type when another client
asserts ownership of the selection by calling
<B><A HREF="../../window-information/XSetSelectionOwner.html">XSetSelectionOwner()</A></B>.

<A NAME="XSelectionClearEvent"></A>
<P>

The structure for this event type contains:

<P>

<!.IN "XSelectionClearEvent" "" "@DEF@">

<PRE><CODE>
typedef struct {
	int type;		/* SelectionClear */
	unsigned long serial;	/* # of last request processed by server */
	Bool send_event;	/* true if this came from a <B><A HREF="../../appendix/a.html#SendEvent">SendEvent</A></B> request */
	Display *display;	/* Display the event was read from */
	Window window;
	Atom selection;
	Time time;
} XSelectionClearEvent;
</PRE></CODE>

<P>

The <B>selection</B> member is set to the selection atom.
The <B>time</B> member is set to the last change time recorded for the 
selection.
The <B>window</B> member is the window that was specified by the current owner
(the owner losing the selection) in its
<B><A HREF="../../window-information/XSetSelectionOwner.html">XSetSelectionOwner()</A></B>
call.
