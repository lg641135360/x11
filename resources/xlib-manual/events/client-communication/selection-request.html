<!.IN "Events" "SelectionRequest">
<!.IN "SelectionRequest" "" "@DEF@">

The X server reports
<B>SelectionRequest</B>
events to the owner of a selection.
The X server generates this event whenever a client 
requests a selection conversion by calling 
<B><A HREF="../../window-information/XConvertSelection.html">XConvertSelection()</A></B>
for the owned selection.

<A NAME="XSelectionRequestEvent"></A>
<P>

The structure for this event type contains:

<P>

<!.IN "XSelectionRequestEvent" "" "@DEF@">

<PRE><CODE>
typedef struct {
	int type;		/* SelectionRequest */
	unsigned long serial;	/* # of last request processed by server */
	Bool send_event;	/* true if this came from a <B><A HREF="../../appendix/a.html#SendEvent">SendEvent</A></B> request */
	Display *display;	/* Display the event was read from */
	Window owner;
	Window requestor;
	Atom selection;
	Atom target;
	Atom property;
	Time time;
} XSelectionRequestEvent;
</PRE></CODE>

<P>

The <B>owner</B> member is set to the window
that was specified by the current owner in its
<B><A HREF="../../window-information/XSetSelectionOwner.html">XSetSelectionOwner()</A></B>
call.
The <B>requestor</B> member is set to the window requesting the selection.
The <B>selection</B> member is set to the atom that names the selection.
For example, PRIMARY is used to indicate the primary selection.
The <B>target</B> member is set to the atom that indicates the type
the selection is desired in.
The <B>property</B> member can be a property name or 
<B>None</B>.
The <B>time</B> member is set to the timestamp or 
<B>CurrentTime</B>
value from the
<B>ConvertSelection</B>
request.

<P>

The owner should convert the selection based on the specified target type
and send a
<B><A HREF="selection.html">SelectionNotify</A></B>
event back to the requestor.
A complete specification for using selections is given in the X Consortium
standard <A HREF="/gui/x/icccm/"><I>Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual</I></A>.
