<!.IN "Events" "CirculateRequest">
<!.IN "CirculateRequest" "" "@DEF@">

The X server can report
<B>CirculateRequest</B>
events to clients wanting information about 
when another client initiates a circulate window request 
on a specified window.
The X server generates this event type whenever a client initiates a circulate
window request on a window and a subwindow actually needs to be restacked. 
The client initiates a circulate window request on the window by calling
<B><A HREF="../../window/XCirculateSubwindows.html">XCirculateSubwindows()</A></B>,
<B><A HREF="../../window/XCirculateSubwindowsUp.html">XCirculateSubwindowsUp()</A></B>,
or
<B><A HREF="../../window/XCirculateSubwindowsDown.html">XCirculateSubwindowsDown()</A></B>.

<P>

To receive
<B>CirculateRequest</B>
events, set the
<B>SubstructureRedirectMask</B>
in the <A HREF="../../window/attributes/event-and-do-not-propagate.html">event-mask</A> attribute of the window. 
Then, in the future,
the circulate window request for the specified window is not executed,
and thus, any subwindow's position in the stack is not changed.
For example, suppose a client application calls
<B><A HREF="../../window/XCirculateSubwindowsUp.html">XCirculateSubwindowsUp()</A></B>
to raise a subwindow to the top of the stack.
If you had selected
<B>SubstructureRedirectMask</B>
on the window, the X server reports to you a
<B>CirculateRequest</B>
event and does not raise the subwindow to the top of the stack.

<A NAME="XCirculateRequestEvent"></A>
<P>

The structure for this event type contains:

<P>

<!.IN "XCirculateRequestEvent" "" "@DEF@">

<CODE><PRE>

typedef struct {
	int type;		/* CirculateRequest */
	unsigned long serial;	/* # of last request processed by server */
	Bool send_event;	/* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
	Display *display;	/* Display the event was read from */
	Window parent;
	Window window;
	int place;		/* PlaceOnTop, PlaceOnBottom */
} XCirculateRequestEvent;
</PRE></CODE>

<P>

The <B>parent</B> member is set to the parent window.
The <B>window</B> member is set to the subwindow to be restacked.
The <B>place</B> member is set to what the new position in the stacking order should be
and is either
<B>PlaceOnTop</B>
or
<B>PlaceOnBottom</B>.
If it is
<B>PlaceOnTop</B>,
the subwindow should be on top of all siblings.
If it is
<B>PlaceOnBottom</B>,
the subwindow should be below all siblings.
