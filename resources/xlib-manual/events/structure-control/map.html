<!.IN "Events" "MapRequest">
<!.IN "MapRequest" "" "@DEF@">
The X server can report
<B>MapRequest</B>
events to clients wanting information about a different client's desire 
to map windows.
A window is considered mapped when a map window request completes.
The X server generates this event whenever a different client initiates 
a map window request on an unmapped window whose override_redirect member 
is set to
<B>False</B> .
Clients initiate map window requests by calling
<B><A HREF="../../window/XMapWindow.html">XMapWindow()</A></B>,
<B><A HREF="../../window/XMapRaised.html">XMapRaised()</A></B>,
or
<B><A HREF="../../window/XMapSubwindows.html">XMapSubwindows()</A></B>.

<P>

To receive
<B>MapRequest</B>
events, set the
<B>SubstructureRedirectMask</B>
bit in the <A HREF="../../window/attributes/event-and-do-not-propagate.html">event-mask</A> attribute of the window. 
This means another client's attempts to map a child window by calling one of
the map window request functions is intercepted, and you are sent a 
<B>MapRequest</B>
instead.
For example, suppose a client application calls
<B><A HREF="../../window/XMapWindow.html">XMapWindow()</A></B>
to map a window.
If you (usually a window manager) had selected
<B>SubstructureRedirectMask</B>
on the parent window and if the <A HREF="../../window/attributes/override-redirect.html">override-redirect</A> attribute 
of the window is set to
<B>False</B>,
the X server reports a
<B>MapRequest</B>
event to you 
and does not map the specified window.
Thus, this event gives your window manager client the ability 
to control the placement of subwindows.

<A NAME="XMapRequestEvent">
<P>

The structure for this event type contains:

<P>

<!.IN "XMapRequestEvent" "" "@DEF@">

<CODE><PRE>

typedef struct {
	int type;	/* MapRequest */
	unsigned long serial;	/* # of last request processed by server */
	Bool send_event;	/* true if this came from a <B><A HREF="../../appendix/a.html#SendEvent">SendEvent</A></B> request */
	Display *display;	/* Display the event was read from */
	Window parent;
	Window window;
} XMapRequestEvent;
</PRE></CODE>

<P>

The <B>parent</B> member is set to the parent window.
The <B>window</B> member is set to the window to be mapped.
