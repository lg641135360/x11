<H1 ALIGN=center>10.7.1 Normal Focus Events and Focus Events While Grabbed</H1>

Normal focus events are identified by
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusInEvent</A>
or
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusOutEvent</A>
structures whose <B>mode</B> member is set to 
<B>NotifyNormal</B>.
Focus events while grabbed are identified by
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusInEvent</A>
or
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusOutEvent</A>
structures whose <B>mode</B> member is set to 
<B>NotifyWhileGrabbed</B>.
The X server processes normal focus and focus events while grabbed according to 
the following:

<UL>

<P><LI>
When the focus moves from window A to window B, A is an inferior of B, 
and the pointer is in window P, 
the X server does the following:

<UL>

<P><LI>
It generates a
<B><A HREF="./">FocusOut</A></B>
event on window A, with the detail member of the
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusOutEvent</A>
structure set to 
<B>NotifyAncestor</B>. 

<P><LI>
It generates a
<B><A HREF="./">FocusOut</A></B>
event on each window between window A and window B, exclusive,
with the <B>detail</B> member of each
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusOutEvent</A>
structure set to 
<B>NotifyVirtual</B>.

<P><LI>
It generates a
<B><A HREF="./">FocusIn</A></B>
event on window B, with the <B>detail</B> member of the 
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusOutEvent</A>
structure set to 
<B>NotifyInferior</B>.

<P><LI>
If window P is an inferior of window B
but window P is not window A or an inferior or ancestor of window A,
it generates a
<B><A HREF="./">FocusIn</A></B>
event on each window below window B, down to and including window P, 
with the <B>detail</B> member of each 
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusInEvent</A>
structure set to 
<B>NotifyPointer</B>.
</UL>

<P><LI>
When the focus moves from window A to window B, B is an inferior of A, 
and the pointer is in window P, 
the X server does the following:

<UL>

<P><LI>
If window P is an inferior of window A
but P is not an inferior of window B or an ancestor of B,
it generates a
<B><A HREF="./">FocusOut</A></B>
event on each window from window P up to but not including window A,
with the <B>detail</B> member of each 
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusOutEvent</A>
structure set to  
<B>NotifyPointer</B>.

<P><LI>
It generates a
<B><A HREF="./">FocusOut</A></B>
event on window A,
with the <B>detail</B> member of the
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusOutEvent</A>
structure set to  
<B>NotifyInferior</B>. 

<P><LI>
It generates a
<B><A HREF="./">FocusIn</A></B>
event on each window between window A and window B, exclusive, with the 
<B>detail</B> member of each 
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusInEvent</A>
structure set to  
<B>NotifyVirtual</B>. 

<P><LI>
It generates a
<B><A HREF="./">FocusIn</A></B>
event on window B, with the <B>detail</B> member of the 
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusInEvent</A>
structure set to  
<B>NotifyAncestor</B>.
</UL>

<P><LI>
When the focus moves from window A to window B, 
window C is their least common ancestor, 
and the pointer is in window P, 
the X server does the following:

<UL>

<P><LI>
If window P is an inferior of window A,
it generates a
<B><A HREF="./">FocusOut</A></B>
event on each window from window P up to but not including window A, 
with the <B>detail</B> member of the 
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusOutEvent</A>

structure set to  
<B>NotifyNonlinearVirtual</B>.

<P><LI>
It generates a

<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusInEvent</A>
structure set to  
<B>NotifyNonlinear</B>.

<P><LI>
If window P is an inferior of window B, it generates a
<B><A HREF="./">FocusIn</A></B>

<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusInEvent</A>
