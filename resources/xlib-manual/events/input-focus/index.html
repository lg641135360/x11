<P>

<!.IN "Events" "FocusIn">
<!.IN "Events" "FocusOut">
This section describes the processing that occurs for the input focus events
<B>FocusIn</B>
and
<B>FocusOut</B>.
<!.IN "FocusIn" "" "@DEF@">
<!.IN "FocusOut" "" "@DEF@">
The X server can report
<B>FocusIn</B>
or
<B>FocusOut</B>
events to clients wanting information about when the input focus changes.
The keyboard is always attached to some window 
(typically, the root window or a top-level window), 
which is called the focus window.
The focus window and the position of the pointer determine the window that
receives keyboard input.
Clients may need to know when the input focus changes
to control highlighting of areas on the screen.

<P>

To receive
<B>FocusIn</B>
or
<B>FocusOut</B>
events, set the
<B>FocusChangeMask</B>
bit in the <A HREF="../../window/attributes/event-and-do-not-propagate.html">event-mask</A> attribute of the window. 

<P>

The structure for these event types contains:

<A NAME="XFocusChangeEvent"></A>
<A NAME="XFocusInEvent"></A>
<A NAME="XFocusOutEvent"></A>

<!.IN "XFocusChangeEvent" "" "@DEF@">

typedef struct {

<P>

The <B>window</B> member is set to the window on which the
<B>FocusIn</B>
or
<B>FocusOut</B>
event was generated.
This is the window used by the X server to report the event. 
The <B>mode</B> member is set to indicate whether the focus events 
are normal focus events, 
focus events while grabbed,
focus events
when a grab activates, or focus events when a grab deactivates.
The X server can set the mode member to 
<B>NotifyNormal</B>,
<B>NotifyWhileGrabbed</B>,
<B>NotifyGrab</B>,
or
<B>NotifyUngrab</B>.

<P>

All 
<B>FocusOut</B>
events caused by a window unmap are generated after any
<B>UnmapNotify</B>
event; however, the X protocol does not constrain the ordering of 
<B>FocusOut</B>
events with respect to
generated 
<B><A HREF="../window-entry-exit/">EnterNotify</A></B>,
<B><A HREF="../window-entry-exit/">LeaveNotify</A></B>,
<B><A HREF="../window-state-change/visibility.html">VisibilityNotify</A></B>,
and
<B><A HREF="../exposure/expose.html">Expose</A></B>
events.

<P>

Depending on the event mode,
the <B>detail</B> member is set to indicate the notify detail and can be
<B>NotifyAncestor</B>,
<B>NotifyVirtual</B>,
<B>NotifyInferior</B>,
<B>NotifyNonlinear</B>,
<B>NotifyNonlinearVirtual</B>,
<B>NotifyPointer</B>,
<B>NotifyPointerRoot</B>,
or
<B>NotifyDetailNone</B>.
