<H1 ALIGN=center>10.7.2 Focus Events Generated by Grabs</H1>

Focus events in which the keyboard grab activates
are identified by
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusInEvent</A>
or
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusOutEvent</A>
structures whose <B>mode</B> member is set to 
<B>NotifyGrab</B>.
Focus events in which the keyboard grab deactivates
are identified by
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusInEvent</A>
or
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusOutEvent</A>
structures whose <B>mode</B> member is set to 
<B>NotifyUngrab</B> 
(see 
<B><A HREF="../../input/XGrabKeyboard.html">XGrabKeyboard()</A></B>).

<UL>


<P><LI>
When a keyboard grab activates before generating any actual 
<B><A HREF="../keyboard-pointer/keyboard-pointer.html">KeyPress</A></B>
event that activates the grab,
G is the grab_window, and F is the current focus, 
the X server does the following:

<UL>

<P><LI>
It generates 
<B><A HREF="./">FocusIn</A></B>
and
<B><A HREF="./">FocusOut</A></B>
events, with the <B>mode</B> members of the 
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusInEvent</A>
and
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusOutEvent</A>
structures set to 
<B>NotifyGrab</B>.
These events are generated
as if the focus were to change from
F to G.
</UL>

<P><LI>
When a keyboard grab deactivates after generating any actual
<B><A HREF="../keyboard-pointer/keyboard-pointer.html">KeyRelease</A></B>
event that deactivates the grab,
G is the grab_window, and F is the current focus,
the X server does the following:

<UL>

<P><LI>
It generates 
<B><A HREF="./">FocusIn</A></B>
and
<B><A HREF="./">FocusOut</A></B>
events, with the <B>mode</B> members of the 
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusInEvent</A>
and
<A HREF="./#XFocusChangeEvent">XFocusOutEvent</A>
structures set to
<B>NotifyUngrab</B>.
These events are generated
as if the focus were to change from
G to F.
