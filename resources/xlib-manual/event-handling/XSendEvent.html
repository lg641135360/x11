<H2>Arguments</H2>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD> <B>display</B>
<TD> Specifies the connection to the X server.

<TR><TD> <B>w</B>
<TD> Specifies the window the event is to be sent to, or
<B>PointerWindow</B>,
or
<B>InputFocus</B>.

<TR><TD> <B>propagate</B>
<TD> Specifies a Boolean value.

<TR><TD> <B>event_mask</B>
<TD> Specifies the event mask.

<TR><TD> <B>event_send</B>
<TD> Specifies the event that is to be sent.

</TABLE>

<H2>Description</H2>

The
<B>XSendEvent()</B>
function identifies the destination window, 
determines which clients should receive the specified events, 
and ignores any active grabs.
This function requires you to pass an event mask.
For a discussion of the valid event mask names,
see section "<A HREF="../events/mask.html">Event Masks</A>".
This function uses the w argument to identify the destination window as follows:

<UL>


<P><LI>
If w is
<B>PointerWindow</B>,
the destination window is the window that contains the pointer.

<P><LI>
If w is
<B>InputFocus</B> 
and if the focus window contains the pointer, 
the destination window is the window that contains the pointer; 
otherwise, the destination window is the focus window.

</UL>

<P>

To determine which clients should receive the specified events,
<B>XSendEvent()</B>
uses the propagate argument as follows:

<UL>

<P><LI>
If event_mask is the empty set,
the event is sent to the client that created the destination window.
If that client no longer exists,
no event is sent.

<P><LI>
If propagate is 
<B>False</B>,
the event is sent to every client selecting on destination any of the event
types in the event_mask argument.

<P><LI>
If propagate is 
<B>True</B> 
and no clients have selected on destination any of
the event types in <A HREF="../window/attributes/event-and-do-not-propagate.html">event-mask</A>, the destination is replaced with the
closest ancestor of destination for which some client has selected a
type in event-mask and for which no intervening window has that type in its
<A HREF="../window/attributes/event-and-do-not-propagate.html">do-not-propagate-mask</A>. 
If no such window exists or if the window is
an ancestor of the focus window and 
<B>InputFocus</B> 
was originally specified
as the destination, the event is not sent to any clients.
Otherwise, the event is reported to every client selecting on the final
destination any of the types specified in event_mask.

</UL>

<P>

The event in the
<A HREF="../events/structures.html#XEvent">XEvent</A>
structure must be one of the core events or one of the events
defined by an extension (or a 
<B>BadValue</B>
error results) so that the X server can correctly byte-swap 
the contents as necessary.  
The contents of the event are
otherwise unaltered and unchecked by the X server except to force send_event to
<B>True</B>
in the forwarded event and to set the serial number in the event correctly;
therefore these fields
and the display field are ignored by
<B>XSendEvent()</B>.

<P>

<B>XSendEvent()</B>
returns zero if the conversion to wire protocol format failed
and returns nonzero otherwise.

<P>

<B>XSendEvent()</B>
can generate
<B>BadValue</B>
and 
<B>BadWindow</B> 
errors.

<H2>Diagnostics</H2>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD><B>BadValue</B>
<TD> Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the request.
     Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined
     by the argument's type is accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of
     alternatives can generate this error.

<TR><TD><B>BadWindow</B>
<TD>A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
