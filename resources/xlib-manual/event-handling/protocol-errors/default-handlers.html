<H1 ALIGN=center>11.8.2 Using the Default Error Handlers</H1>

<!.IN "Debugging" "error handlers">
<!.IN "Error" "handlers">
There are two default error handlers in Xlib: 
one to handle typically fatal conditions (for example, 
the connection to a display server dying because a machine crashed) 
and one to handle protocol errors from the X server.
These error handlers can be changed to user-supplied routines if you
prefer your own error handling and can be changed as often as you like.
If either function is passed a NULL pointer, it will
reinvoke the default handler.
The action of the default handlers is to print an explanatory
message and exit.

<P>

To set the error handler, use
<B><A HREF="XSetErrorHandler.html">XSetErrorHandler()</A></B>.

<A NAME="XErrorEvent"></A>
<P>

The 
<B>XErrorEvent</B>
structure contains:
<!.IN "Debugging" "error event">

<P>

<!.IN "XErrorEvent" "" "@DEF">
<PRE><CODE>
typedef struct {
	int type;
	<A HREF="../../display/opening.html#Display">Display</A> *display;		/* Display the event was read from */
	unsigned long serial;		/* serial number of failed request */
	unsigned char error_code;	/* error code of failed request */
	unsigned char request_code;	/* Major op-code of failed request */
	unsigned char minor_code;	/* Minor op-code of failed request */
	XID resourceid;			/* resource id */
} XErrorEvent;
</PRE></CODE>

<P>

<!.IN "Serial Number">
The <B>serial</B> member is the number of requests, starting from one, 
sent over the network connection since it was opened. 
It is the number that was the value of 
<B><A HREF="../../display/display-macros.html#NextRequest">NextRequest()</A></B>
immediately before the failing call was made.  
The <B>request_code</B> member is a protocol request
of the procedure that failed, as defined in 
<B><TT>X11/Xproto.h .</TT></B>
The following error codes can be returned by the functions described in this
chapter:

<TABLE>
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2><HR>
<TR><TD><B>Error Code	<TH>Description
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2><HR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>BadAccess
<TD>A client attempts to grab a key/button combination already grabbed 
by another client.

<P>

A client attempts to free a colormap entry that it had not already allocated
or to free an entry in a colormap that was created with all entries writable.

<P>

A client attempts to store into a read-only or unallocated colormap entry.

<P>

A client attempts to modify the access control list from other than the local 
(or otherwise authorized) host.

<P>

A client attempts to select an event type that another client 
has already selected.

<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>BadAlloc
<TD>
The server fails to allocate the requested resource.
Note that the explicit listing of
<B>BadAlloc</B>
errors in requests only covers allocation errors at a very coarse level
and is not intended to (nor can it in practice hope to) cover all cases of
a server running out of allocation space in the middle of service.
The semantics when a server runs out of allocation space are left unspecified,
but a server may generate a
<B>BadAlloc</B>
error on any request for this reason,
and clients should be prepared to receive such errors and handle or discard
them.

<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>BadAtom
<TD>
A value for an atom argument does not name a defined atom.

<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>BadColor
<TD>
A value for a colormap argument does not name a defined colormap.

<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>BadCursor
<TD>
A value for a cursor argument does not name a defined cursor.

<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>BadDrawable
<TD>
A value for a drawable argument does not name a defined window or pixmap.

<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>BadFont
<TD>
A value for a font argument does not name a defined font (or, in some cases, 
<B><A HREF="/toto/GContext.html">GContext</A></B>).

<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>BadGC
<TD>
A value for a 
<B><A HREF="/toto/GContext.html">GContext</A></B> 
argument does not name a defined 
<B><A HREF="/toto/GContext.html">GContext</A></B> .

<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>BadIDChoice
<TD>
The value chosen for a resource identifier either is not included in the 
range assigned to the client or is already in use.
Under normal circumstances,
this cannot occur and should be considered a server or Xlib error.

<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>BadImplementation
<TD>
The server does not implement some aspect of the request.
A server that generates this error for a core request is deficient.
As such, this error is not listed for any of the requests,
but clients should be prepared to receive such errors 
and handle or discard them.

<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>BadLength
<TD>
The length of a request is shorter or longer than that required to 
contain the arguments.
This is an internal Xlib or server error.

<P>

The length of a request exceeds the maximum length accepted by the server.

<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>BadMatch
<TD>
In a graphics request,
the root and depth of the graphics context does not match that of the drawable.

<P>

An 
<B><A HREF="../../window/create.html#InputClass">InputOnly</A></B> 
window is used as a drawable.

<P>

Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and range,
but it fails to match in some other way required by the request.

<P>

An 
<B><A HREF="../../window/create.html#InputClass">InputOnly</A></B> 
window lacks this attribute.

<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>BadName
<TD>
A font or color of the specified name does not exist.

<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>BadPixmap
<TD>
A value for a pixmap argument does not name a defined pixmap.

<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>BadRequest
<TD>
The major or minor opcode does not specify a valid request.
This usually is an Xlib or server error.

<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>BadValue
<TD>
Some numeric value falls outside of the range of values accepted 
by the request.  
Unless a specific range is specified for an argument,
the full range defined by the argument's type is accepted.
Any argument defined as a set of alternatives typically can generate
this error (due to the encoding).

<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>BadWindow
<TD>
A value for a window argument does not name a defined window.
