<H1 ALIGN=center>11.7 Getting Pointer Motion History</H1>

Some X server implementations will maintain a more complete
history of pointer motion than is reported by event notification.
The pointer position at each pointer hardware interrupt may be
stored in a buffer for later retrieval.
This buffer is called the motion history buffer.
For example, a few applications, such as paint programs,
want to have a precise history of where the pointer
traveled. 
However, this historical information is highly excessive for most applications.

<P>

To determine the approximate maximum number of elements in the motion buffer, 
use

<P>

To get the motion history for a specified window and time, use
<B><A HREF="XGetMotionEvents.html">XGetMotionEvents()</A></B>.
