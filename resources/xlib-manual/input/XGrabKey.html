<H2>Arguments</H2>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD> <B>display</B>
<TD> Specifies the connection to the X server.

<TR><TD> <B>keycode</B>
<TD> Specifies the KeyCode or
<B>AnyKey</B>.

<TR><TD> <B>modifiers</B>
<TD> Specifies the set of keymasks or
<B>AnyModifier</B>.
The mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid keymask bits.

<TR><TD> <B>grab_window</B>
<TD> Specifies the grab window.

<TR><TD> <B>owner_events</B>
<TD> Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether the keyboard events 
are to be reported as usual.

<TR><TD> <B>pointer_mode</B>
<TD> Specifies further processing of pointer events.
You can pass 
<B>GrabModeSync</B> 
or
<B>GrabModeAsync</B>.

<TR><TD> <B>keyboard_mode</B>
<TD> Specifies further processing of keyboard events.
You can pass 
<B>GrabModeSync</B> 
or
<B>GrabModeAsync</B>.

</TABLE>

<H2>Description</H2>

The
<B>XGrabKey()</B>
function establishes a passive grab on the keyboard.
In the future,
the keyboard is actively grabbed (as for
<B><A HREF="XGrabKeyboard.html">XGrabKeyboard()</A></B>),
the last-keyboard-grab time is set to the time at which the key was pressed
(as transmitted in the
<B><A HREF="../events/keyboard-pointer/keyboard-pointer.html">KeyPress</A></B>
event), and the
<B><A HREF="../events/keyboard-pointer/keyboard-pointer.html">KeyPress</A></B>
event is reported if all of the following conditions are true:

<UL>


<P><LI>
The keyboard is not grabbed and the specified key
(which can itself be a modifier key) is logically pressed
when the specified modifier keys are logically down,
and no other modifier keys are logically down.

<P><LI>
Either the grab_window is an ancestor of (or is) the focus window,
or the grab_window is a descendant of the focus window and contains the pointer.

<P><LI>
A passive grab on the same key combination does not exist
on any ancestor of grab_window.

</UL>

<P>

The interpretation of the remaining arguments is as for 
<B><A HREF="XGrabKeyboard.html">XGrabKeyboard()</A></B>.
The active grab is terminated automatically when the logical state of the
keyboard has the specified key released
(independent of the logical state of the modifier keys).

<P>

Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by client applications)
may lag the physical state if device event processing is frozen.

<P>

A modifiers argument of 
<B>AnyModifier</B>
is equivalent to issuing the request for all
possible modifier combinations (including the combination of no
modifiers).  
It is not required that all modifiers specified have
currently assigned KeyCodes.
A keycode argument of 
<B>AnyKey</B>
is equivalent to issuing
the request for all possible KeyCodes.
Otherwise, the specified keycode must be in
the range specified by min_keycode and max_keycode in the connection
setup, 
or a
<B>BadValue</B>
error results.

<P>

If some other client has issued a 
<B>XGrabKey()</B>
with the same key combination on the same window, a 
<B>BadAccess</B> 
error results.
When using
<B>AnyModifier</B>
or 
<B>AnyKey</B>,
the request fails completely,
and a
<B>BadAccess</B> 
error results (no grabs are established) 
if there is a conflicting grab for any combination.

<P>

<B>XGrabKey()</B>
can generate
<B>BadAccess</B> ,
<B>BadValue</B> , 
and
<B>BadWindow</B> 
errors.

<H2>Diagnostics</H2>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD><B>BadAccess</B>
<TD> A client attempted to free a color map entry that
it did not already allocate.
<TR><TD><B>BadAccess</B>
<TD> A client attempted to store into a read-only color
     map entry.

<TR><TD><B>BadValue</B>
<TD> Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the request.
     Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined
     by the argument's type is accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of
     alternatives can generate this error.

<TR><TD><B>BadWindow</B>
<TD>A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
