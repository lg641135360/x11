<H2>Arguments</H2>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD> <B>display</B>
<TD> Specifies the connection to the X server.

<TR><TD> <B>focus</B>
<TD> Specifies the window,
<B>PointerRoot</B>,
or
<B>None</B>.

<TR><TD> <B>revert_to</B>
<TD> Specifies where the input focus reverts to if the window becomes not
viewable.
You can pass 
<B>RevertToParent</B>, 
<B>RevertToPointerRoot</B>, 
or 
<B>RevertToNone</B>.

<TR><TD> <B>time</B>
<TD> Specifies the time.
You can pass either a timestamp or
<B>CurrentTime</B>.

</TABLE>

<H2>Description</H2>

The
<B>XSetInputFocus()</B>
function changes the input focus and the last-focus-change time.
It has no effect if the specified time is earlier than the current
last-focus-change time or is later than the current X server time.
Otherwise, the last-focus-change time is set to the specified time
(<B>CurrentTime</B> 
is replaced by the current X server time).
<B>XSetInputFocus()</B>
causes the X server to generate
<B><A HREF="../events/input-focus/">FocusIn</A></B> 
and 
<B><A HREF="../events/input-focus/">FocusOut</A></B> 
events.

<P>

Depending on the focus argument,
the following occurs: 

<UL>

<P><LI>
If focus is
<B>None</B>,
all keyboard events are discarded until a new focus window is set,
and the revert_to argument is ignored.

<P><LI>
If focus is a window, 
it becomes the keyboard's focus window.
If a generated keyboard event would normally be reported to this window
or one of its inferiors, the event is reported as usual. 
Otherwise, the event is reported relative to the focus window.

<P><LI>
If focus is
<B>PointerRoot</B>,
the focus window is dynamically taken to be the root window of whatever screen 
the pointer is on at each keyboard event.  
In this case, the revert_to argument is ignored.

<P>

The specified focus window must be viewable at the time 
<B>XSetInputFocus()</B>
is called,
or a
<B>BadMatch</B>
error results.
If the focus window later becomes not viewable, 
the X server
evaluates the revert_to argument to determine the new focus window as follows: 

<P><LI>
If revert_to is
<B>RevertToParent</B>,
the focus reverts to the parent (or the closest viewable ancestor), 
and the new revert_to value is taken to be
<B>RevertToNone</B>.  

<P><LI>
If revert_to is
<B>RevertToPointerRoot</B> 
or 
<B>RevertToNone</B>,
the focus reverts to
<B>PointerRoot</B>
or
<B>None</B>,
respectively.
When the focus reverts,
the X server generates
<B><A HREF="../events/input-focus/">FocusIn</A></B>
and
<B><A HREF="../events/input-focus/">FocusOut</A></B>
events, but the last-focus-change time is not affected.

</UL>

<P>

<B>XSetInputFocus()</B>
can generate
<B>BadMatch</B>,
<B>BadValue</B>,
and
<B>BadWindow</B> 
errors.

<H2>Diagnostics</H2>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD><B>BadMatch</B>
<TD>An
<B><A HREF="../window/create.html#InputClass">InputOnly</A></B>
window is used as a Drawable.
<TR><TD><B>BadMatch</B>
<TD>Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and range but fails
    to match in some other way required by the request.

<TR><TD><B>BadMatch</B>
<TD>An
<B><A HREF="../window/create.html#InputClass">InputOnly</A></B>
window is used as a Drawable.
<TR><TD><B>BadMatch</B>
<TD>Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and range but fails
    to match in some other way required by the request.

<TR><TD><B>BadValue</B>
<TD> Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the request.
     Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined
     by the argument's type is accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of
     alternatives can generate this error.

<TR><TD><B>BadWindow</B>
<TD>A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
