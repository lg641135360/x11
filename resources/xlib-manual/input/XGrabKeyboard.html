<H2>Arguments</H2>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD> <B>display</B>
<TD> Specifies the connection to the X server.

<TR><TD> <B>grab_window</B>
<TD> Specifies the grab window.

<TR><TD> <B>owner_events</B>
<TD> Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether the keyboard events 
are to be reported as usual.

<TR><TD> <B>pointer_mode</B>
<TD> Specifies further processing of pointer events.
You can pass 
<B>GrabModeSync</B> 
or
<B>GrabModeAsync</B>.

<TR><TD> <B>keyboard_mode</B>
<TD> Specifies further processing of keyboard events.
You can pass 
<B>GrabModeSync</B> 
or
<B>GrabModeAsync</B>.

<TR><TD> <B>time</B>
<TD> Specifies the time.
You can pass either a timestamp or
<B>CurrentTime</B>.

</TABLE>

<H2>Description</H2>

The
<B>XGrabKeyboard()</B>
function actively grabs control of the keyboard and generates
<B><A HREF="../events/input-focus/">FocusIn</A></B>
and
<B><A HREF="../events/input-focus/">FocusOut</A></B>
events.
Further key events are reported only to the
grabbing client.
<B>XGrabKeyboard()</B>
overrides any active keyboard grab by this client.
If owner_events is 
<B>False</B>, 
all generated key events are reported with
respect to grab_window.  
If owner_events is 
<B>True</B>  
and if a generated
key event would normally be reported to this client, it is reported
normally; otherwise, the event is reported with respect to the
grab_window.  
Both 
<B><A HREF="../events/keyboard-pointer/keyboard-pointer.html">KeyPress</A></B> 
and 
<B><A HREF="../events/keyboard-pointer/keyboard-pointer.html">KeyRelease</A></B> 
events are always reported,
independent of any event selection made by the client.

<P>

If the keyboard_mode argument is 
<B>GrabModeAsync</B>,
keyboard event processing continues
as usual. 
If the keyboard is currently frozen by this client, 
then processing of keyboard events is resumed.
If the keyboard_mode  argument is
<B>GrabModeSync</B> ,
the state of the keyboard (as seen by client applications) appears to freeze,
and the X server generates no further keyboard events until the
grabbing client issues a releasing 
<B><A HREF="XAllowEvents.html">XAllowEvents()</A></B>
call or until the keyboard grab is released.
Actual keyboard changes are not lost while the keyboard is frozen; 
they are simply queued in the server for later processing.

<P>

If pointer_mode is 
<B>GrabModeAsync</B> ,
pointer event processing is unaffected
by activation of the grab.  
If pointer_mode is 
<B>GrabModeSync</B> ,
the state of the pointer (as seen by client applications) appears to freeze, 
and the X server generates no further pointer events 
until the grabbing client issues a releasing 
<B><A HREF="XAllowEvents.html">XAllowEvents()</A></B>
call or until the keyboard grab is released.
Actual pointer changes are not lost while the pointer is frozen; 
they are simply queued in the server for later processing.

<P>

If the keyboard is actively grabbed by some other client,
<B>XGrabKeyboard()</B>
fails and returns
<B>AlreadyGrabbed</B>.
If grab_window is not viewable,
it fails and returns
<B>GrabNotViewable</B>.
If the keyboard is frozen by an active grab of another client,
it fails and returns
<B>GrabFrozen</B>.
If the specified time is earlier than the last-keyboard-grab time 
or later than the current X server time,
it fails and returns
<B>GrabInvalidTime</B>.
Otherwise, the last-keyboard-grab time is set to the specified time
(<B>CurrentTime</B> 
is replaced by the current X server time).

<P>

<B>XGrabKeyboard()</B>
can generate
<B>BadValue</B>
and 
<B>BadWindow</B> 
errors.

<H2>Diagnostics</H2>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD><B>BadValue</B>
<TD> Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the request.
     Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined
     by the argument's type is accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of
     alternatives can generate this error.

<TR><TD><B>BadWindow</B>
<TD>A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
