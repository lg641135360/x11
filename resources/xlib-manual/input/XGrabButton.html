<H2>Arguments</H2>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD> <B>display</B>
<TD> Specifies the connection to the X server.

<TR><TD> <B>button</B>
<TD> Specifies the pointer button that is to be grabbed or
<B>AnyButton</B>.

<TR><TD> <B>modifiers</B>
<TD> Specifies the set of keymasks or
<B>AnyModifier</B>.
The mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid keymask bits.

<TR><TD> <B>grab_window</B>
<TD> Specifies the grab window.

<TR><TD> <B>owner_events</B>
<TD> Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether the pointer 
events are to be reported as usual or reported with respect to the grab window 
if selected by the event mask.

<TR><TD> <B>event_mask</B>
<TD> Specifies which pointer events are reported to the client.
The mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid pointer event mask bits.

<TR><TD> <B>pointer_mode</B>
<TD> Specifies further processing of pointer events.
You can pass 
<B>GrabModeSync</B> 
or
<B>GrabModeAsync</B>.

<TR><TD> <B>keyboard_mode</B>
<TD> Specifies further processing of keyboard events.
You can pass 
<B>GrabModeSync</B> 
or
<B>GrabModeAsync</B>.

<TR><TD> <B>confine_to</B>
<TD> Specifies the window to confine the pointer in or
<B>None</B>.

<TR><TD> <B>cursor</B>
<TD> Specifies the cursor that is to be displayed or
<B>None</B>.

</TABLE>

<H2>Description</H2>

The
<B>XGrabButton()</B>
function establishes a passive grab.
In the future,
the pointer is actively grabbed (as for
<B><A HREF="XGrabPointer.html">XGrabPointer()</A></B>),
the last-pointer-grab time is set to the time at which the button was pressed
(as transmitted in the
<B><A HREF="../events/keyboard-pointer/keyboard-pointer.html">ButtonPress</A></B>
event), and the
<B><A HREF="../events/keyboard-pointer/keyboard-pointer.html">ButtonPress</A></B>
event is reported if all of the following conditions are true:

<UL>


<P><LI>
The pointer is not grabbed, and the specified button is logically pressed
when the specified modifier keys are logically down,
and no other buttons or modifier keys are logically down.

<P><LI>
The grab_window contains the pointer.

<P><LI>
The confine_to window (if any) is viewable.

<P><LI>
A passive grab on the same button/key combination does not exist
on any ancestor of grab_window.

</UL>

<P>

The interpretation of the remaining arguments is as for
<B><A HREF="XGrabPointer.html">XGrabPointer()</A></B>.
The active grab is terminated automatically when the logical state of the
pointer has all buttons released
(independent of the state of the logical modifier keys).

<P>

Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by client applications)
may lag the physical state if device event processing is frozen.

<P>

This request overrides all previous grabs by the same client on the same
button/key combinations on the same window.
A modifiers of 
<B>AnyModifier</B>
is equivalent to issuing the grab request for all
possible modifier combinations (including the combination of no modifiers).  
It is not required that all modifiers specified have currently assigned 
KeyCodes.
A button of 
<B>AnyButton</B>
is equivalent to
issuing the request for all possible buttons.
Otherwise, it is not required that the specified button currently be assigned
to a physical button.

<P>

If some other client has already issued a 
<B>XGrabButton()</B>
with the same button/key combination on the same window, a
<B>BadAccess</B>
error results.
When using 
<B>AnyModifier</B>
or 
<B>AnyButton</B>, 
the request fails completely,
and a
<B>BadAccess</B>
error results (no grabs are
established) if there is a conflicting grab for any combination.
<B>XGrabButton()</B>
has no effect on an active grab.

<P>

<B>XGrabButton()</B>
can generate
<B>BadCursor</B>,
<B>BadValue</B>,
and
<B>BadWindow</B> 
errors.

<H2>Diagnostics</H2>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD><B>BadCursor</B> 
<TD>A value for a Cursor argument does not name a
    defined Cursor.

<TR><TD><B>BadValue</B>
<TD> Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the request.
     Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined
     by the argument's type is accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of
     alternatives can generate this error.

<TR><TD><B>BadWindow</B>
<TD>A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
