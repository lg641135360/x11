This is the conversion of the Xlib Programming Manual into HTML, brought 
to you by <A HREF="/">Christophe Tronche</A>. This work is far from
being complete, as you may soon notice, and is provided "as is"
("as usual"). Many links have been made provision for, but actually aren't
translated yet. If you're more interested in some part of the manual,
let me know and I'll push further on it.

<P>

<IMG SRC="/images/new11.gif" WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=25> By popular demand, you
can now get the manual as 
<A HREF="http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/~tronche/xlib-manual.tar.gz">one <TT>.tar.gz</TT> file</A>.

<P>

This work is based on X11 release 6.
